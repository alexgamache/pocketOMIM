				"History":"Garrod (1894) first reported the association between Down syndrome and heart malformation. Abbott (1924) drew attention to the association between AVSD and Down syndrome.\n\nNeri and Opitz (2009) provided a detailed review of the history of the scientific developments leading to the molecular characterization of Down syndrome.\n\nSpeculation about the historic prevalence of Down syndrome has included references to apparent depictions of the syndrome in 15th (Ward, 2004) and 16th (Levitas and Reid, 2003) century paintings. Martinez-Frias (2005) reported what seems likely to be the earliest evidence of the syndrome in a terra-cotta head from approximately 500 AD belonging to the Tolteca culture of Mexico, in which 'it is easy to identify the short palpebral fissures, oblique eyes, midface hypoplasia, and open mouth with macroglossia, findings that clearly define the face of a person with Down syndrome.'\n\nBernal and Briceno (2006) examined pottery artifacts from the Tumaco-La Tolita culture, which existed on the border of present-day Colombia and Ecuador approximately 2,500 years ago, and described several figurines with characteristics suggestive of Down syndrome. Bernal and Briceno (2006) believed these artifacts to be among the earliest artistic representations of disease.",

				"History": "Atresia of the ileum was reported by Blanck et al. (1965) in 2 brothers with cystic fibrosis; 2 other sibs had cystic fibrosis without intestinal atresia.\n\nSpock et al.

Serum from heterozygotes contained an amount of the factor intermediate between none (the normal situation) and the level in patients.\n\nSmith et al. (1968) found cystic fibrosis in a child with cri-du-chat syndrome (123450). Only the mother was heterozygous by Spock test. They suggested that loss of part of the short arm of the chromosome 5 derived from the father had occurred and that the deleted portion carried the cystic fibrosis locus. Danes and Bearn (1968) found vesicular metachromasia in the fibroblasts of both parents suggesting that the reported experience cannot be taken as evidence of localization of the CF gene on the short arm of chromosome 5.\n\nEdwards et al. (1984) reported a family in which deficiency at the tip of 13q was associated with cystic fibrosis. Weak evidence supporting assignment to 13q was provided by a boy with both cystic fibrosis and hemophilia A; no translocation was visualized but the authors postulated a telomeric translocation that disrupted both loci at the tip of the X chromosome and chromosome 13. They cited 2 other observations of cystic fibrosis with chromosome 13 abnormality.\n\nWilliamson (1984) excluded cystic fibrosis from chromosome 13; none of the DNA probes that were monosomic in the case of Edwards et al.

Hemoglobin polymerization, leading to erythrocyte rigidity and vasoocclusion, is central to the pathophysiology of the disease, but the importance of chronic anemia, hemolysis, and vasculopathy has been established. The most common cause of sickle cell anemia is the HbS variant, with hemoglobin SS disease being most prevalent in Africans.",
				"History": "Savitt and Goldberg (1989) gave an interesting account of investigations into the story of Walter Clement Noel, the first-to-be-described case of sickle cell anemia (Herrick, 1910). Noel, a first-year dental student at the Chicago College of Dental Surgery, was admitted to the Presbyterian Hospital in late 1904 where Ernest E. Irons, a 27-year-old intern, obtained a history and performed routine physical, blood, and urine examinations. He noticed that Noel's blood smear contained 'many pear-shaped and elongated forms' and alerted his attending physician, James B. Herrick, to the unusual blood findings. Irons drew a rough sketch of these erythrocytes in the hospital record. Herrick and Irons followed Noel over the next 2.5 years through several episodes of severe illness as he continued his dental studies. Thereafter, Noel returned to Grenada to practice dentistry. He died 9 years later at the age of 32. Curiously, Irons, who lived from 1877 to 1959, was not included by Herrick, who lived from 1861 to 1964, in the authorship.\n\nConner et al. (1983) synthesized two 19-base-long oligonucleotides, 1 complementary to the 5-prime end of the normal beta-globin gene and 1 complementary to the sickle cell gene. DNA from normal homozygotes showed hybridization only for the first probe; DNA from persons with sickle cell anemia showed hybridization only with the second; DNA from sickle cell anemia heterozygotes showed hybridization with both. Allele-specific hybridization of oligonucleotides was proposed as a general method for diagnosis of any genetic disease which involves a point mutation in a single-copy gene.",

The cardinal features occur in 3 systems--skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular. It shares overlapping features with congenital contractural arachnodactyly, which is caused by mutation in the FBN2 gene.",
				"History": "Marfan (1896) first described the skeletal features of this disorder in a 5.5-year-old girl, Gabrielle P. He referred to the condition as dolichostenomelia (long, thin limbs). Hecht and Beals (1972) thought that this condition was in fact CCA. The association of ectopia lentis was reported by Boerger (1914). A systematic review of the literature by Ruettimann and Steinmann (1996) revealed that the eponymic designation was first proposed by Carrau (1929) who explained why the terms dolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, acromacria, and hyperchondroplasia were incomplete and unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the 1950s studies of a relatively large number of patients and their families delineated the natural history of the Marfan syndrome, particularly the cardiovascular complications (McKusick, 1955), defined the range of pleiotropism and variability, and established its autosomal dominant inheritance.\n\nBecause the disorder was expressed in the heterozygote, a unitary defect of a structural, nonenzymic element of connective tissue seemed likely. In 1956, it was possible to write (McKusick, 1956): 'What the suspensory ligament of the lens has in common with the media of the aorta is obscure. If [this were known], the basic defect of the [Marfan] syndrome might be understood.' Indeed, the abundance of fibrillin in the suspensory ligament as well as in the periosteum of bone and the aortic media was a key factor in focusing attention on that connective tissue protein (McKusick, 1991).",

				"Description": "Fragile X syndrome is characterized by moderate to severe mental retardation, macroorchidism, and distinct facial features, including long face, large ears, and prominent jaw. In most cases, the disorder is caused by the unstable expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene and abnormal methylation, which results in suppression of FMR1 transcription and decreased protein levels in the brain.",
				"History": "The X-linked mental retardation reported by Martin and Bell (1943) is the same as the fragile X syndrome. Opitz et al. (1984) referred to this disorder as the 'Martin-Bell syndrome' on the assumption that the family reported from the Queen Square Hospital in London by J. Purdon Martin and Julia Bell (Martin and Bell, 1943) had that disorder. Although macroorchidism was not mentioned by Martin and Bell (1943), one of the patients was described as having a 'big face and jaw;' furthermore, at least 9 of the affected males were maternal grandsons of 2 unaffected brothers. All but 1 of the mothers of affected males were daughters of these 2 brothers, the other being their sister. Martin and Bell (1943) hypothesized that some controlling factor caused suppression of the disease in the 2 grandfathers without affecting their liability to transmit it. For a superb biography of Julia Bell (1879-1979), see Bundey (1996).\n\nRichards et al. (1981) followed up on the Martin-Bell kindred, demonstrating that it was indeed the fragile X syndrome. The original index patient was then aged 56. All 4 affected males who had adequate karyotyping showed the fragile X syndrome in 17 to 50% of their cells. The other major contribution of Julia Bell was in the defining of many hereditary disorders, such as the forms of brachydactyly, on the basis of massive collections of pedigrees in the famous Treasury of Human Inheritance. She also collaborated with J. B. S. Haldane in the first estimation of linkage in the human, that of colorblindness and hemophilia (Bell and Haldane, 1937).\n\nAccording to Opitz and Sutherland (1984), Escalante, a graduate student with Frota-Pessoa in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Drs. Bryan and Gillian Turner in Sydney, Australia, independently noted the association of macroorchidism with X-linked mental retardation in the late 1960s. Escalante et al. (1971) published their findings (which they had reported in 1969 at the Warsaw Congress of the International Association for the Scientific Study of Mental Deficiency) in the Journal de Genetique Humaine. While visiting the Drs. Turner in Sydney, McKusick (1970) examined several patients with mental retardation and macroorchidism.",

				"History": "In 1872, George Huntington of Pomeroy, Ohio, wrote about a hereditary form of chorea 'which exists, so far as I know, almost exclusively on the east end of Long Island.' Osler (1893) wrote about this disorder as follows: 'Twenty years have passed since Huntingdon (sic), in a postscript to an every-day sort of article on chorea minor, sketched most graphically, in 3 or 4 paragraphs, the characters of a chronic and hereditary form which he, his father and grandfather had observed in Long Island.' As with many other conditions, Osler's writings about them brought the disorder to general attention. In a footnote, he stated: 'Several years ago I made an attempt to get information about the original family which the Huntingdons (sic) described, but their physician stated that, owing to extreme sensitiveness on the subject, the patients could not be seen.' Vessie (1932) traced the ancestry of the families studied by Huntington (1872). About 1,000 cases in 12 generations descendant from 2 brothers in Suffolk, England, could be identified. Uncertainty concerning the usual interpretation (Critchley, 1973; Maltsberger, 1961; Vessie, 1932) of the precise origin of the Huntington gene in England was voiced by Caro and Haines (1975).",

				"Description": "DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) comprises hypocalcemia arising from parathyroid hypoplasia, thymic hypoplasia, and outflow tract defects of the heart. Disturbance of cervical neural crest migration into the derivatives of the pharyngeal arches and pouches can account for the phenotype. Most cases result from a deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 (the DiGeorge syndrome chromosome region, or DGCR). Several genes are lost including the putative transcription factor TUPLE1 which is expressed in the appropriate distribution. This deletion may present with a variety of phenotypes: Shprintzen, or velocardiofacial, syndrome (VCFS; 192430); conotruncal anomaly face (or Takao syndrome); and isolated outflow tract defects of the heart including tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, and interrupted aortic arch. A collective acronym CATCH22 has been proposed for these differing presentations. A small number of cases of DGS have defects in other chromosomes, notably 10p13 (see 601362). In the mouse, a transgenic Hox A3 (Hox 1.5) knockout produces a phenotype similar to DGS as do the teratogens retinoic acid and alcohol.",

DiGeorge (1968) published a formal report 3 years later. The report by Strong (1968) predated this formal report and probably represents the same variable disorder. Kimura (1977) reported velopharyngeal deficiency in a series of patients without cleft palate. The Japanese language report by Kinouchi et al. (1976) and the English reports, by Takao et al. (1980)and Shimizu et al. (1984), delineated the syndrome in the Japanese population. The acronym CATCH22 derives from the phrase Catch 22, which was used by Joseph Heller as the title of his book (Heller, 1962).",

Approximately two-thirds of the mutations in both forms are deletions of one or many exons in the dystrophin gene. Although there is no clear correlation found between the extent of the deletion and the severity of the disorder, DMD deletions usually result in frameshift. Boland et al.

Severe effects of the disease usually do not appear until after decades of progressive iron loading. Removal of excess iron by therapeutic phlebotomy decreases morbidity and mortality if instituted early in the course of the disease. Classic hemochromatosis (HFE) is most often caused by mutation in a gene designated HFE on chromosome 6p21.3.",
				"History": "The first description of hemochromatosis is attributed to Trousseau (1865). His first patient was a 28-year-old man with severe diabetes. Trousseau wrote: 'From the time this man came into the hospital, I was struck by the almost bronzed appearance of his countenance, and the blackish color of his penis.' At autopsy the liver was found to be very large. 'The entire surface of the organ was granular; it was of a uniform grayish-yellow color; it was very dense, resisting pressure so much as to prevent penetration by the finger. It creaked under the scalpel, and the surface of the cut was granular in place of being smooth.'\n\nThe hereditary nature of hemochromatosis was emphasized particularly by Sheldon (1935). In his classic monograph entitled 'Haemochromatosis,' Sheldon (1935) reviewed references to a familial or hereditary basis of the disease made by 14 authors and stated: 'Further evidence is greatly desirable on this aspect of the disease, since the fact of an occasional familial incidence must obviously be taken into account in any theory regarding the origin of the disease.'",

Patients with mild hemophilia usually bleed excessively only after trauma or surgery, whereas those with severe hemophilia have an annual average of 20 to 30 episodes of spontaneous or excessive bleeding after minor trauma, particularly into joints and muscles. These symptoms differ substantially from those of bleeding disorders due to platelet defects or von Willebrand disease (193400), in which mucosal bleeding predominates (review by Mannucci and Tuddenham, 2001)",
				"History": "Early reports of hemophilia families emanated from this country beginning with a newspaper account in 1792 (McKusick, 1962) and continuing with medical reports by Otto in 1803 and Hay in 1813 (McKusick, 1962).

Gill et al.

DNA-based sex testing and short-tandem repeat analysis confirmed that a family group was present in the grave. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed an exact sequence match between the putative Tsarina and the 3 children and a living maternal relative. Amplified mtDNA extracted from the remains of the putative Tsar demonstrated heteroplasmy at a single base within the mtDNA control region. One of these sequences matched 2 living maternal relatives of the Tsar. The DNA data indicated that 1 of the princesses and Tsarevich Alexei were missing from the grave. ",

				"Description": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism resulting from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH; 612349), an enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine, the rate-limiting step in phenylalanine catabolism. If undiagnosed and untreated, phenylketonuria can result in impaired postnatal cognitive development resulting from a neurotoxic effect of hyperphenylalaninemia (Zurfluh et al., 2008).",
				"History": "Folling (1934) in Norway first described PKU under the designation oligophrenica phenylpyruvica. Jervis (1947) localized the metabolic error as an inability to oxidize phenylalanine to tyrosine, and Jervis (1953) demonstrated deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase in the liver of a patient.\n\nGuthrie (1996) gave a history of his introduction of newborn screening for PKU. A shift in his research from cancer research to the study of mental retardation had been prompted by the birth of his second child with mental retardation. He learned that the phenylalanine-restricted diet introduced for treatment of PKU required close monitoring of blood Phe levels for which the methods were then laborious. He conceived of modifying the bacterial test he was using to screen for different substances in the blood of patients who were being treated for cancer. These tests relied on 'competitive inhibition;' a compound that normally prevented growth of bacteria in culture plates no longer inhibited the growth when large amounts of Phe was present in a blood spot that was added to the plate. The birth of a niece who was found to have PKU at the age of 15 months also had an influence on his research. Since a positive ferric chloride urine test came too late to prevent her mental retardation, he became interested in developing a blood test for neonates. He had been using filter paper discs soaked in serum from the patient to be studied. He found, however, that whole blood worked equally well and facilitated newborn screening. Newborn screening with the heel stick began in 1961 and was reported by Guthrie and Susi (1963). In the first 2 years, 400,000 infants were tested in 29 states and 39 cases of PKU were found--an incidence of about 1 per 10,000. None was missed by screening. Guthrie (1996) noted that the National Association for Retarded Children through its state chapters lobbied vigorously for laws for PKU screening despite much opposition by organized medical groups; 37 states had such laws by 1967.\n\nBickel (1996) described his first introduction to the disease PKU in 1949 at the University Children's Hospital Zurich where Professor G. Fanconi instructed Bickel to perform the ferric chloride test in every retarded patient. Later, on moving to the University Children's Hospital in Birmingham, he introduced the ferric chloride test there and found a patient whose mother urged him to find a way to help the daughter. Under the pressure of this mother, Bickel, Gerrard, and Hickmans (Bickel et al., 1953) speculated that there might be a causal relation between the Phe excess in the biologic fluids and the girl's brain damage and that it might be possible to improve her condition by reducing Phe intake. The use of a Phe-restricted casein hydrolysate as the main protein source of the diet was considered. Early results were dramatic.",

				"Description": "PKD1, an autosomal dominant form of polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), has the cardinal manifestations of renal cysts, liver cysts, and intracranial aneurysm. Acute and chronic pain and nephrolithiasis are common complications. The most serious renal complication is end-stage renal disease, which occurs in approximately 50% of patients by the age of 60 years. The typical age of onset is in middle life, but the range is from infancy to 80 years (summary by Wu and Somlo, 2000). ",
				"History": "Chanmugam et al. (1971) reported a family that might suggest linkage of hereditary spherocytosis (see 182900) and polycystic kidney disease. A father and 3 children had both diseases. Three other children and 4 sibs of the father were thought to be free of both diseases. There is, however, no other suggestion of location of a spherocytosis locus on chromosome 16, or chromosome 4 (cf. 173910), where genes for adult polycystic kidney disease have been mapped. ",

				"Description": "Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by diminished fetal activity, obesity, muscular hypotonia, mental retardation, short stature, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and small hands and feet. It can be considered to be an autosomal dominant disorder and is caused by deletion or disruption of a gene or several genes on the proximal long arm of the paternal chromosome 15 or maternal uniparental disomy 15, because the gene(s) on the maternal chromosome(s) 15 are virtually inactive through imprinting. Horsthemke and Wagstaff (2008) provided a detailed review of the mechanisms of imprinting of the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome (105830) region.",
				"History": "Langdon-Down (1828-1896), who described 'mongolism' (Down syndrome), also described PWS (Down, 1887) about 70 years before Prader et al. (1956), and called it polysarcia (see account by Brain, 1967). The patient was a mentally subnormal girl who, when 13 years old, was 4 feet 4 inches tall (1.32 m) and weighed 196 lbs (84 kg). At 25 years of age she weighed 210 lbs (95.4 kg). 'Her feet and hands remained small, and contrasted remarkably with the appendages they terminated. She had no hair in the axillae, and scarcely any on the pubis. She had never menstruated, nor did she exhibit the slightest sexual instinct.'",

				"Description": "Spinal muscular atrophy refers to a group of autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorders characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, leading to symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy (summary by Wirth, 2000).\n\nFour types of SMA are recognized depending on the age of onset, the maximum muscular activity achieved, and survivorship: type I, severe infantile acute SMA, or Werdnig-Hoffman disease; type II (253550), or infantile chronic SMA; type III (253400), juvenile SMA, or Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander disease; and type IV (271150), or adult-onset SMA. All types are caused by recessive mutations in the SMN1 gene.",
				"History": "Becker (1964) suggested an allelic model for the clinically distinct subtypes of SMA: 3 or more normal alleles (a, a', a'') in addition to the pathologic gene a(+). The genotype a'a(+) was thought to lead to Kugelberg-Welander phenotype and the a''a(+) genotype to the Werdnig-Hoffmann phenotype. Bouwsma and Leschot (1986) extended the allele hypothesis of Becker. They presented clinical and genetic findings in 18 patients from 7 pedigrees showing an unusual genetic pattern not consistent with simple autosomal recessive inheritance. In 6 of the 7 pedigrees, different types of SMA were present. However, Muller et al. (1992) presented evidence rejecting the Becker hypothesis. In a sample of 4 sibships in which both SMA type II and SMA type III occurred, the segregation of linked markers indicated that the same allele was involved. The finding suggested that other factors, genetic or environmental, must determine disease severity in SMA.\n\nKleyn et al. (1991) excluded both the HEXB locus (606873) and the GM2-activator protein locus (GM2A; 613109), both of which are located on chromosome 5, as the site of the mutation in SMA. Recombination between HEXB and SMA eliminated this enzyme as a candidate site. Furthermore, the gene encoding the activator protein was found to map distal to the SMA I locus (Heng et al., 1993).",
