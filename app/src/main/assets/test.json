				"Description": "Down syndrome, the most frequent form of mental retardation caused by a microscopically demonstrable chromosomal aberration, is characterized by well-defined and distinctive phenotypic features and natural history. It is caused by triplicate state (trisomy) of all or a critical portion of chromosome 21.",
				"History":"Garrod (1894) first reported the association between Down syndrome and heart malformation. Abbott (1924) drew attention to the association between AVSD and Down syndrome.\n\nNeri and Opitz (2009) provided a detailed review of the history of the scientific developments leading to the molecular characterization of Down syndrome.\n\nSpeculation about the historic prevalence of Down syndrome has included references to apparent depictions of the syndrome in 15th (Ward, 2004) and 16th (Levitas and Reid, 2003) century paintings. Martinez-Frias (2005) reported what seems likely to be the earliest evidence of the syndrome in a terra-cotta head from approximately 500 AD belonging to the Tolteca culture of Mexico, in which 'it is easy to identify the short palpebral fissures, oblique eyes, midface hypoplasia, and open mouth with macroglossia, findings that clearly define the face of a person with Down syndrome.'\n\nBernal and Briceno (2006) examined pottery artifacts from the Tumaco-La Tolita culture, which existed on the border of present-day Colombia and Ecuador approximately 2,500 years ago, and described several figurines with characteristics suggestive of Down syndrome. Bernal and Briceno (2006) believed these artifacts to be among the earliest artistic representations of disease.",
				"Clinical Features": "\"Down syndrome (Down, 1866), a particular combination of phenotypic features that includes mental retardation and characteristic facies, is caused by trisomy 21 (Lejeune et al., 1959), one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in liveborn children.\n\nIt has long been recognized that the risk of having a child with trisomy 21 increases with maternal age (Penrose, 1933). For example, the risk of having a liveborn with Down syndrome at maternal age 30 is 1 in 1,000 and at maternal age 40 is 9 in 1,000 (Hook, 1982; Hook et al., 1983). \n\nIndividuals with Down syndrome often have specific major congenital malformations such as those of the heart (30-40% in some studies), particularly atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), and of the gastrointestinal tract, such as duodenal stenosis or atresia, imperforate anus, and Hirschsprung disease (142623). Some of these clinical features have been incorporated into the preliminary phenotypic maps of chromosome 21 developed by Korenberg (1993), Korenberg et al. (1992), and Delabar et al. (1993). \n\nLeukemia (both ALL and AML) and leukemoid reactions show increased incidence in Down syndrome (Fong and Brodeur, 1987; Robinson, 1992). Estimates of the relative risk have ranged from 10 to 20 times higher than the normal population; in particular, acute megakaryocytic leukemia occurs 200 to 400 times more frequently in the Down syndrome than in the chromosomally normal population (Zipursky et al., 1987). Transient leukemoid reactions have been reported repeatedly in the neonatal period, and this phenotype has been tentatively mapped to the proximal long arm of chromosome 21 (Niikawa et al., 1991). \n\nNinety percent of all Down syndrome patients have a significant hearing loss, usually of the conductive type (Mazzoni et al., 1994). \n\nFor additional defects and phenotypic characteristics, see Epstein (1989).\n\nPatients with Down syndrome develop the neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease at a much earlier age than individuals with Alzheimer disease without trisomy 21 (Wisniewski et al., 1985). Characteristic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are present in the brain of all individuals with Down syndrome over the age of 40 years (Wisniewski et al., 1985). The triplication of the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP; 104760) may be the cause of this phenomenon. Several mutations in the APP gene have been described in families with early-onset Alzheimer disease without trisomy 21 (e.g., Goate et al., 1991). \n\nCastilla et al. (1998) performed an epidemiologic analysis of the association of polydactyly with other congenital anomalies in 5,927 consecutively born polydactyly cases. Trisomy 13, Meckel syndrome (249000), and Down syndrome explained 255 of the 338 syndromic polydactyly cases. Down syndrome was strongly associated with first-digit duplication, and negatively associated with postaxial polydactyly. \n\nIn a retrospective study of high-altitude pulmonary edema performed at Children's Hospital in Denver, Durmowicz (2001) identified 6 of 52 patients as having Down syndrome. Five of the 6 children had preexisting illnesses including chronic pulmonary hypertension, existing cardiac defects with left-to-right shunt, or previous defects of left-to-right shunt that had been repaired. One child had Eisenmenger syndrome. Durmowicz (2001) suggested caution in traveling to even moderate altitudes with children with Down syndrome. \n\nTo determine whether newborns with DS have decreased blood T4 (thyroxine; tetraiodothyronine) concentrations at the time of the neonatal screening, van Trotsenburg et al. (2003) conducted an observational study in a large and representative cohort of Dutch children with DS born in 1996 and 1997. Results of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) screening measuring T4, TSH (see 188540), and T4-binding globulin (314200) concentrations were analyzed in comparison with clinical information obtained by interviewing the parents and data from the general newborn population and a large control group. The mean T4 concentration of the 284 studied children with DS was significantly decreased. The individual T4 concentrations were normally (Gaussian) distributed but shifted to lower concentrations. Mean TSH and T4-binding globulin concentrations were significantly increased and normal, respectively. The decreased T4 concentration, left-shifted normal distribution, and mildly elevated TSH concentrations pointed to a mild hypothyroid state in newborns with DS and supported the existence of a DS-specific thyroid (regulation) disorder. \n\nIn a case-control study, Tyler et al. (2004) found that the rate of symptomatic gallbladder disease was 25% among 28 index cases of adults with Down syndrome compared to 4.5% among sex-matched controls (p = 0.002). The adjusted relative risk for gallbladder disease among individuals with Down syndrome was 3.52. \n\nHenry et al. (2007) examined complete blood counts obtained in the first week of life from 158 consecutive neonates with Down syndrome and found that neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and polycythemia were the most common hematologic abnormalities, occurring in 80%, 66%, and 33% of patients, respectively. \n\nSurvival\n\nZhu et al. (2013) studied survival among individuals with Down syndrome from the Danish population using a national cohort of 3,530 persons with Down syndrome identified from the Danish Cytogenetic Register and a reference cohort of persons without Down syndrome randomly selected from the general population followed from 1 April 1968 to 15 January 2009 by linkages to the Register of Causes of Death and the Civil Registration System. Overall, persons with Down syndrome had higher mortality than the reference cohort but to a lesser degree for persons with mosaic trisomy 21 than for persons with standard trisomy 21 or with Robertsonian translocations (hazard ratio 4.98 (95% CI 3.52-7.08), 8.94 (8.32-9.60) and 10.23 (7.50-13.97), respectively). Among persons with Down syndrome born after April 1968, more recent birth cohorts had lower mortality rates than older birth cohorts, which was largely due to declining mortality among persons with Down syndrome who also had congenital heart defects. \"\n",
				"Diagnosis": "During the second trimester of pregnancy, serum alpha-feto protein (AFP; 104150) is commonly used for evaluating the risk of Down syndrome. Decreased levels of AFP are indicative of Down syndrome. However, Petit et al. (2009) noted that a congenital deficiency of AFP may result in decreased AFP in the maternal serum and amniotic fluid. They reported a male fetus with congenital absence of AFP, due to a truncating mutation (104150.0003), who showed normal growth and development. \n\nTsui et al. (2010) showed that analysis of PLAC4 (613770) can aid in the noninvasive prenatal detection of trisomy 21 using maternal plasma samples. PLAC4 is transcribed from chromosome 21 in the placenta and is specific for the fetus in maternal plasma. One analytic method, termed the RNA-SNP approach, measures the ratio of alleles for a SNP in placenta-derived mRNA molecules in maternal plasma. The RNA-SNP approach detected the deviated RNA-SNP allelic ratio in PLAC4 mRNA caused by an imbalance in chromosome 21 dosage. In a study of 153 pregnant women, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity using this method was 100% and 89.7%, respectively. In fetuses homozygous for the SNP, a second analytic approach was used, which quantifies circulating PLAC4 mRNA concentrations. Trisomy 21 pregnancies showed significantly increased plasma PLAC mRNA compared to unaffected pregnancies. The sensitivity and specificity of this method were 91.7% and 81.0% using real-time PCR, and 83.3% and 83.5% using digital PCR. The overall findings suggested that the synergistic use of these 2 methods will increase the yield of correct diagnosis of trisomy 21 using noninvasive methods. ",
				"Cytogenetics": "Most individuals (95%) with trisomy 21 have 3 free copies of chromosome 21; in about 5% of patients, 1 copy is translocated to another acrocentric chromosome, most often chromosome 14 or 21 (Thuline and Pueschel, 1982; Hook, 1982). In 2 to 4% of cases with free trisomy 21 there is recognizable mosaicism for a trisomic and a normal cell line (Mikkelsen, 1977). \n\nOrigin of Free Trisomy 21\n\nThe availability of highly informative DNA markers has allowed the parental origin of the extra chromosome 21 and the meiotic/mitotic origin to be determined. More than 400 families have been studied (Antonarakis et al. (1991, 1992); Antonarakis, 1993; Sherman et al. (1991, 1992)) and the results are as follows: (1) Errors in meiosis that lead to trisomy 21 are overwhelmingly of maternal origin; only about 5% occur during spermatogenesis. (2) Most errors in maternal meiosis occur in meiosis I and the mean maternal age associated with these is 32 years (the mean maternal age of the general population is approximately 27 years). Thus, meiosis I errors account for 76 to 80% of maternal meiotic errors and 67 to 73% of all instances of free trisomy 21. (3) Maternal meiosis II errors constitute 20 to 24% of maternal errors and 18 to 20% of all cases of free trisomy 21. The mean maternal age is also advanced and is 31.4 in one study and 34.1 in another. (4) In rare families in which there is paternal nondisjunction, most of the errors occur in meiosis II. The mean maternal and paternal ages are similar to the mean reproductive age in western societies. (5) In 5% of trisomic individuals the supernumerary chromosome 21 appears to result from an error in mitosis. In these cases there is no advanced maternal age and there is no preference for which chromosome 21 is duplicated in the mitotic error. \n\nWarren et al. (1987) and Sherman et al. (1991) have described an association between trisomy 21 and reduced recombination in meioses. A significant proportion (at least 30%) of maternal meiosis I nondisjunctions of chromosome 21 is associated with failure to recombine. It is not known whether the paucity of recombination is related to maternal age; moreover, the mechanism of recombination failure (asynapsis vs abnormalities during or after synapsis) is as yet unclear. \n\nThere is a well-established association between altered recombination patterns and nondisjunction of human chromosomes. Brown et al. (2000) investigated the possibility of reduced recombination in the total genome of an egg with a nondisjoined chromosome 21 and no detectable recombination. By genotyping 15 patients (at 366 autosomal markers) with trisomy 21, as well as their parents and maternal grandparents, the authors found a statistically significant genomewide reduction (p less than 0.05) in the mean recombination rate in these eggs with nondisjoined chromosomes 21. This reduction was felt to be consistent with normal variation in recombination observed among eggs. The authors hypothesized that when the number of genomewide recombination events is less than some threshold, specific chromosomes may be at an increased risk for nondisjunction. \n\nOrigin of Translocation Trisomy 21\n\nAll de novo t(14;21) trisomies studied have originated in maternal germ cells (Petersen et al., 1991; Shaffer et al., 1992). The mean maternal age was 29.2 years. In de novo t(21;21) Down syndrome the situation is different (Grasso et al., 1989; Antonarakis et al., 1990; Shaffer et al., 1992). In most cases (14 out of 17) the t(21;21) is an isochromosome (dup21q) rather than the result of a Robertsonian translocation caused by a fusion between 2 heterologous chromatids. About half were of paternal and half of maternal origin. In the 3 de novo t(21;21) true Robertsonian trisomy 21 cases, the extra chromosome 21 was maternal",
				"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations": "Lyle et al. (2009) used array comparative genomic hybridization to analyze 30 patients with anomalies of chromosome 21, including 19 with partial trisomy 21 and 11 with partial monosomy 21, all for different segments of the chromosome. They also examined the phenotypes of 5 patients with a Down syndrome-like phenotype with a normal karyotype and 6 with complete trisomy 21. The majority of the phenotypes mapped to distal 21; averaging the phenotype score indicated a region approximately 37 to 44 Mb, which was involved in most Down syndrome phenotypes. These results were not surprising, as this is the most gene-rich region of chromosome 21. Five patients were trisomic for proximal 21 and did not include the so-called Down syndrome critical region (DSCR), thus excluding the possibility there is a single DSCR responsible for all aspects of the phenotype. \n"

				"Description": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is classically described as a triad of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and elevation of sodium and chloride concentration in sweat. Almost all males with CF are infertile due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. The disorder is associated with decreased longevity.",
				"History": "Atresia of the ileum was reported by Blanck et al. (1965) in 2 brothers with cystic fibrosis; 2 other sibs had cystic fibrosis without intestinal atresia.\n\nSpock et al. (1967) observed that patients have a factor in serum that inhibits the action of cilia in explants of rabbit tracheal mucosa. Serum from heterozygotes contained an amount of the factor intermediate between none (the normal situation) and the level in patients.\n\nSmith et al. (1968) found cystic fibrosis in a child with cri-du-chat syndrome (123450). Only the mother was heterozygous by Spock test. They suggested that loss of part of the short arm of the chromosome 5 derived from the father had occurred and that the deleted portion carried the cystic fibrosis locus. Danes and Bearn (1968) found vesicular metachromasia in the fibroblasts of both parents suggesting that the reported experience cannot be taken as evidence of localization of the CF gene on the short arm of chromosome 5.\n\nEdwards et al. (1984) reported a family in which deficiency at the tip of 13q was associated with cystic fibrosis. Weak evidence supporting assignment to 13q was provided by a boy with both cystic fibrosis and hemophilia A; no translocation was visualized but the authors postulated a telomeric translocation that disrupted both loci at the tip of the X chromosome and chromosome 13. They cited 2 other observations of cystic fibrosis with chromosome 13 abnormality.\n\nWilliamson (1984) excluded cystic fibrosis from chromosome 13; none of the DNA probes that were monosomic in the case of Edwards et al. (1984) were linked to cystic fibrosis in studies of affected sibs.",
				"Clinical Features": "The mildest extreme of CF is represented by patients not diagnosed until middle age (Scully et al., 1977). The phenotypic variability in CF was analyzed by Sing et al. (1982). In an inbred kindred in North Carolina, a mild form of cystic fibrosis was described by Knowles et al. (1989). There was 1 instance of mother-daughter involvement, the mother being related to her husband. One of the presumed homozygotes was a 62-year-old woman. Another was her 52-year-old sister, the mother of the affected proposita. The daughter was an intensive care nurse, the mother of a normal daughter. Manifestations in the family were predominantly pulmonary; pancreatic exocrine insufficiency was not a conspicuous feature, especially in the older patients. \n\nThe 2 subgroups defined by the A and C haplotypes of polymorphisms closely linked to the CF locus on chromosome 7, reported by Estivill et al. (1987), have clinical differences in terms of the frequency of meconium ileus, pseudomonas infections, and pancreatic disease (Woo, 1988). \n\nGasparini et al. (1990) described a RFLP DNA marker closely linked to the CF locus which showed an allelic correlation with severity of the disorder: the genotype 2/2 was associated with severe disease; the genotype 1/2 was overrepresented in patients with very mild clinical manifestations, including pancreatic insufficiency, absence of meconium ileus, and absence of Pseudomonas colonization. \n\nMeconium Ileus\n\nAllan et al. (1981) showed that sibs tend to show recurrence of meconium ileus as a feature of cystic fibrosis. The distal intestinal obstruction syndrome is a 'meconium ileus equivalent' that occurs in adolescents and adults with CF. It is the consequence of the abnormally viscid mucofeculant material in the terminal ileum and right colon, where the fecal stream is normally liquid. Typical features are recurrent episodes of RLQ pain with palpable mass in the right iliac fossa. Symptoms are exacerbated by eating. \n\nMornet et al. (1988) determined the haplotype associated with cystic fibrosis in 41 families using 4 DNA probes, all of which are tightly linked to the CF gene. In 17 of the families an affected child had meconium ileus, and in the other 24 families there was a child without meconium ileus. A different haplotype was associated with the 2 types of families, suggesting that multiple allelism, i.e., different mutations at the same locus, accounts for CF with or without meconium ileus. \n\nLiver Disease\n\nGaskin et al. (1988) found that 96% of patients with cystic fibrosis and evidence of liver disease had biliary tract obstruction, usually a stricture of the distal common bile duct. All patients without liver disease had normal intrahepatic and common-duct excretion of tracer. \n\nBilton et al. (1990) described a case of cystic fibrosis complicated by common bile duct stenosis. \n\nGabolde et al. (2001) showed that the presence of cirrhosis in patients with cystic fibrosis is significantly associated with either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the MBL2 gene (154545), which encodes mannose-binding lectin (MBL). The authors compared 216 patients homozygous for the delta-F508 mutation (602421.0001) and found that 5.4% of those homozygous or compound heterozygous for wildtype mannose-binding lectin had cirrhosis, while 30.8% of those homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutant alleles had cirrhosis (p = 0.008). \n\nApproximately 3 to 5% of patients with cystic fibrosis develop severe liver disease defined as cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Bartlett et al. (2009) performed a 2-stage case control study enrolling patients with CF and severe liver disease with portal hypertension from 63 CF centers in the United States as well as 32 in Canada and 18 outside of North America. In the first stage, 124 patients with CF and severe liver disease, enrolled between January 1999 and December 2004, and 843 control patients without CF-related liver disease (all assessed at greater than 15 years of age) were studied by genotyping 9 polymorphisms in 5 genes previously studied as modifiers of liver disease in CF. In the second stage, the 2 genes that were positive from the first stage were tested in an additional 136 patients with CF-related liver disease, enrolled between January 2005 and February 2007, and in 1,088 with no CF-related liver disease. The combined analysis of the initial and replication studies by logistic regression showed CF-related liver disease to be associated with the SERPINA1 Z allele (107400.0011) (odds ratio = 5.04; 95% confidence interval, 2.88-8.83; p = 1.5 x 10(-8)). Bartlett et al. (2009) concluded that the SERPINA1 Z allele is a risk factor for liver disease in CF. Patients carrying the Z allele are at greater risk (odds ratio = approximately 5) of developing severe liver disease with portal hypertension",
				"Diagnosis": "Boue et al. (1986) reported on prenatal diagnostic studies in 200 pregnancies with a presumed 1-in-4 risk of recurrence of cystic fibrosis. The method involved measurement of total enzymes and isoenzymes of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, aminopeptidase M, and alkaline phosphatase in amniotic fluid in the second trimester. The recurrence rate of cystic fibrosis was 22.5% in 147 cases in which the index case had cystic fibrosis without meconium ileus at birth but was 47.5% when the index case had meconium ileus. The authors speculated on the mechanism of the 50% recurrence rate and favored the view that 1 parent was in fact a homozygote for a mild allele. With use of their method, the authors suggested 98% accuracy in prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Allan et al. (1981), Super (1987), and Boue et al. (1986) found that in families in which a CF child did not have meconium ileus the observed recurrence rate agreed with the expected 1-in-4 risk, but that in families with a history of meconium ileus in the index case the recurrence rate was much higher, 43.7% in the study of Boue et al. (1986). Mornet et al. (1989) found different haplotype associations in the 2 types of families. A distortion of the segregation ratio was suggested to explain the high recurrence rate. Estivill et al. (1987) pointed out that individuals with haplotypes A and C as determined by their cosmid library, whether homozygous or heterozygous, have a considerably reduced risk of being carriers as compared to the 1 in 20 average risk in the British population. On the other hand, a homozygote for haplotype B had a risk of about 1 in 7 of being a carrier. It appears that about 85% of cases of CF in northern Europeans have 1 particular haplotype and the rest a second haplotype. CF with or without meconium ileus may be different entities. Baxter et al. (1988) stated that the meconium ileus form of CF is often lethal so that families with this form are underrepresented in linkage studies. On the other hand, couples who seek prenatal diagnosis often have had children with this problem. Harris et al. (1988) found that 30 of 37 British CF families were sufficiently informative with 3 RFLP probes to enable prenatal diagnosis. They also used linkage analysis to exclude CF in 2 cases in which diagnosis of the disease was equivocal in the sib of an affected child. \n\nStrain et al. (1988), Krawczak et al. (1988), and Beaudet et al. (1989) discussed the use of linkage disequilibrium between CF and DNA markers in genetic risk calculation. Handyside et al. (1992) achieved preimplantation diagnosis. In vitro fertilization techniques were used to recover oocytes from each of 3 women and fertilize them with the husband's sperm. Both members of the 3 couples carried the delF508 mutation. Three days after insemination, embryos in the cleavage stage underwent biopsy with removal of 1 or 2 cells for DNA amplification and analysis. In 2 of the women the oocytes produced noncarrier, carrier, and affected embryos. Both couples chose to have 1 noncarrier embryo and 1 carrier embryo transferred. One woman became pregnant and gave birth to a girl free of the deletion in both chromosomes. Curnow (1994) used cystic fibrosis to illustrate how, in genetic counseling, one can calculate carrier risk for recessive diseases when not all the mutant alleles are detectable. Dean (1995) reviewed the 5 main methods used for detecting mutations at the time. \n\nSavov et al. (1995) demonstrated the presence of 2 different mutations carried by the same CF allele in 4 out of 44 Bulgarian CF patients during a systematic search of the entire coding sequence of the CFTR gene. Two of the double mutant alleles include 1 nonsense and 1 missense mutation, and although the nonsense mutation could be considered to be the main defect, the amino acid substitutions are candidates for disease-causing mutations as well. Savov et al. (1995) suggested that double mutant alleles may be more common than expected and could account for some of the problems in phenotype-genotype correlations. Stern (1997) reviewed the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. He presented a table of conditions, all readily distinguishable from cystic fibrosis, that can cause moderately elevated sweat electrolytes. With mutation analysis, in approximately 1% of cases no abnormal gene can be found and in about 18% more only 1 abnormal gene will be identified. Stern (1997) pointed out, however, that even if both genes were abnormal, the patient could have an ameliorating or neutralizing second mutation elsewhere. For example, patients homozygous for delF508 (602421.0001) have normal sweat electrolyte concentrations if a second mutation, R553Q (602421.0121), is also present. \n\nScreening\n\nUnder the chairmanship of Beaudet and Kazazian (1990), a workshop at the National Institutes of Health laid down guidelines concerning screening for the cystic fibrosis gene. The following points were emphasized: screening should be voluntary, and confidentiality must be assured; screening requires informed consent; providers of screening services have an obligation to ensure adequate education and counseling; quality control in all aspects of testing is required; and there should be equal access to testing.\n\nNewborn babies with CF have abnormally high levels of immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) in serum, which has been the basis for a screening test. Hammond et al. (1991) reported on the results of a Colorado statewide test of the feasibility and efficacy of measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen in blood spots to screen for neonatal cystic fibrosis. They found an incidence of cystic fibrosis of 1 in 3,827 (0.26 per 1,000), with 3.2 newborns per 1,000 requiring repeat measurements. When adjusted for race and compliance with testing, the incidence among the white infants (1 in 2,521) was close to the expected incidence. They concluded that screening was feasible and could be implemented with acceptable rates of repeat testing and false positive and false negative results. Laroche and Travert (1991) found 9 F508 deletion heterozygotes among 149 infants with neonatal transitory mild hypertrypsinemia. Dumur et al. (1990) found an increased frequency of heterozygosity for the same mutation in adults with chronic bronchial hypersecretion. \n\nObserving that many patients with cystic fibrosis are malnourished by the time the diagnosis is made, Farrell et al. (1997) sought to determine whether newborn screening and early treatment might prevent the development of nutritional deficiency. A total of 650,341 newborn infants were screened by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen on dried blood spots (from April 1985 through June 1991) or by combining the trypsinogen test with DNA analysis (from July 1991 through June 1994). Of 325,171 infants assigned to an early-diagnosis group, cystic fibrosis was diagnosed in 74 infants, including 5 with negative screening tests. Excluding infants with meconium ileus, Farrell et al. (1997) evaluated nutritional status for up to 10 years by anthropometric and biochemical methods in 56 of the infants who received an early diagnosis and in 40 of the infants in whom the diagnosis was made by standard methods (the control group). Pancreatic insufficiency was managed with nutritional interventions that included high-calorie diets, pancreatic enzyme therapy, and fat-soluble vitamin supplements. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was confirmed by a positive sweat test at a younger age in the early-diagnosis group than in the control group (mean age, 12 vs 72 weeks). At the time of diagnosis, the early-diagnosis group had significantly higher height and weight percentiles and a higher head circumference percentile. The early-diagnosis group also had significantly higher anthropometric indices during the follow-up, especially the children of pancreatic insufficiency and those who were homozygous for the delta-F508 mutation. Dankert-Roelse and te Meerman (1997) raised the question of whether the time had not arrived for adoption of routine neonatal screening for cystic fibrosis. ",
				"Cytogenetics": "Park et al. (1987) concluded that CF is distal to and on the 5-prime side of MET. They determined this by in situ hybridization on metaphase and prometaphase chromosomes of normal lymphocytes as well as lymphoblastoid cells containing a t(5;7)(q35;q22). Normal cells showed clustering of MET grains to 7q31. Furthermore, in the lymphoblastoid cell line, there was significant labeling within the 5q+ chromosome, confirming that MET is located distal to 7q22 with most grains clustered at 7q31. Somatic cell hybrids containing the derivative 7 showed on Southern analysis that the 3-prime portion of the MET gene, but not the 5-prime portion, was located there; thus, MET is at the translocation breakpoint. Studies in another cell line with a 7q32 translocation breakpoint indicated that MET is located at or proximal to 7q32. A break at this site was accompanied by loss of 3 markers within 1 cM of CF, suggesting that if MET is at the breakpoint on 7q31, CF is located distally.\n\nIn the course of studying a case of cystic fibrosis, Spence et al. (1988) discovered what appeared to be a case of uniparental disomy: the father did not contribute alleles to the propositus for markers near the CF locus or for centromeric markers on chromosome 7. High-resolution cytogenetic analysis was normal, and the result could not be explained by nonpaternity or a submicroscopic deletion. Uniparental disomy could be explained by various mechanisms such as monosomic conception with subsequent chromosome gain, trisomic conception followed by chromosome loss, postfertilization error, or gamete complementation. Patients with more than one genetic disorder might be suspected of having isodisomy, which should also be suspected in cases of an apparent new mutation leading to a recessive disorder when only 1 parent is heterozygous, and in cases of females affected with X-linked recessive disorders. Engel (1980) appears to have originated the concept of uniparental disomy and resulting isodisomy. Voss et al. (1988, 1989) also demonstrated uniparental disomy for chromosome 7 in a patient with cystic fibrosis. \n",
				"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations": "Wine (1992) pointed out that CFTR mutations associated with pancreatic sufficiency, milder pulmonary disease, and improved sweat gland function are associated with residual CFTR chloride-ion channel function. He questioned the disruptive effects proposed for the delF508 mutation because variation in homozygotes for this mutation is very large. At the same time, those homozygous for stop codons have been severely affected, showing pancreatic insufficiency and pulmonary function values (FEV1) in the same range as those of delF508 subjects. Disruptive effects of delF508 would be expected to give rise to a dominant pattern of inheritance. Wine (1992) concluded that the observations are consistent with the recessive nature of CF and with the likelihood that gene or protein replacement therapy for CF will be effective on their own, without requiring concomitant silencing of the delF508 gene. Sheppard et al. (1993) found that some CFTR mutations, such as delF508, which disrupt normal processing and hence are missing from the apical membrane, generate no chloride current and are associated with severe disease. Other mutants, such as R117H (602421.0005), R334W (602421.0034), and R347P (602421.0006), which are correctly processed and retain significant apical chloride channel function, are associated with a milder form of the disease. Thus, the CF genotype determines the biochemical abnormality, which determines the clinical phenotype. Because these 3 'mild' mutants have normal regulation, interventions designed to increase the activity of mutant CFTR may have therapeutic efficacy in patients with these mutations. Studying 267 children and adolescents with CF who were regularly seen at the same center, Kubesch et al. (1993) found that the age-specific colonization rates with Pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly lower in pancreatic sufficient than in pancreatic insufficient patients. The missense and splice site mutations that were 'mild' CF alleles with respect to exocrine pancreatic function were also 'low risk' alleles for the acquisition of P. aeruginosa. On the other hand, the proportion of P. aeruginosa-positive patients increased most rapidly in the pancreatic insufficient delF508 compound heterozygotes who were carrying a termination mutation in the nucleotide binding fold-encoding exons. \n\nKulczycki et al. (2003) stated that their oldest patient was a 71-year-old white male who was diagnosed with CF at the age of 27 years because of recurrent nasal polyposis, elevated sweat sodium and chloride, and a history of CF in his 20-year-old sister. The man was married but childless, and practiced as an attorney. Urologic examination revealed CBAVD. Nutritional and pulmonary status were almost normal. At the age of 60 years, genetic testing indicated 2 mutations in the CFTR gene: his1282 to ter (H1282X; 602421.0129), which is associated with severe CF, and ala445 to glu (A445E; 602421.0130), which is associated with mild CF. \n"

		"AKA": "AKA: Sickle Cell Disease",
		"Contents": [
			{
				"Description": "Sickle cell anemia is a multisystem disease associated with episodes of acute illness and progressive organ damage. Hemoglobin polymerization, leading to erythrocyte rigidity and vasoocclusion, is central to the pathophysiology of the disease, but the importance of chronic anemia, hemolysis, and vasculopathy has been established. The most common cause of sickle cell anemia is the HbS variant, with hemoglobin SS disease being most prevalent in Africans.",
				"History": "Savitt and Goldberg (1989) gave an interesting account of investigations into the story of Walter Clement Noel, the first-to-be-described case of sickle cell anemia (Herrick, 1910). Noel, a first-year dental student at the Chicago College of Dental Surgery, was admitted to the Presbyterian Hospital in late 1904 where Ernest E. Irons, a 27-year-old intern, obtained a history and performed routine physical, blood, and urine examinations. He noticed that Noel's blood smear contained 'many pear-shaped and elongated forms' and alerted his attending physician, James B. Herrick, to the unusual blood findings. Irons drew a rough sketch of these erythrocytes in the hospital record. Herrick and Irons followed Noel over the next 2.5 years through several episodes of severe illness as he continued his dental studies. Thereafter, Noel returned to Grenada to practice dentistry. He died 9 years later at the age of 32. Curiously, Irons, who lived from 1877 to 1959, was not included by Herrick, who lived from 1861 to 1964, in the authorship.\n\nConner et al. (1983) synthesized two 19-base-long oligonucleotides, 1 complementary to the 5-prime end of the normal beta-globin gene and 1 complementary to the sickle cell gene. DNA from normal homozygotes showed hybridization only for the first probe; DNA from persons with sickle cell anemia showed hybridization only with the second; DNA from sickle cell anemia heterozygotes showed hybridization with both. Allele-specific hybridization of oligonucleotides was proposed as a general method for diagnosis of any genetic disease which involves a point mutation in a single-copy gene.",
				"Clinical Features": "Scriver and Waugh (1930) reported detailed studies of a 7-year-old child with sickle cell anemia. Her main complaints were cough, night sweats, vague pains in the legs and joints, occasional abdominal pain, poor appetite, and increasing fatigue. In a series of clever experiments that involved taking venous blood from the arm under different circumstances, the authors showed a correlation between oxygen tension and sickling of the red blood cells in vivo. Increased sickling was observed when oxygen pressure fell below 40 to 45 mm Hg. Scriver and Waugh (1930) concluded that large aggregations of sickle cells seen in sinuses, vessels, and organs of sickle cell patients at autopsy reflected lowered oxygen tension resulting from death. \n\nIn many children with sickle cell anemia, functional asplenia develops during the first year of life and septicemia is the leading cause of death in childhood. The risk of septicemia in sickle cell anemia is greatest during the first 3 years of life and is reduced markedly by prophylactic penicillin therapy. Less is known about splenic dysfunction and the risk of overwhelming sepsis in children with sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease (see HbC; 141900.0038), although functional asplenia has been documented by radionuclide liver-spleen scans in some adult patients (Ballas et al., 1982) and an elevated erythrocyte pit count, a finding that indicates functional asplenia in children with sickle cell anemia, also has been found in some children with SC disease (Pearson et al., 1985). Lane et al. (1994) reported 7 fatal cases of pneumococcal septicemia in children with SC disease. The earliest death occurred in a 1-year-old child who had cyanotic congenital heart; the other children were aged 3.5 to 15 years. Only 1 child had received pneumococcal vaccine or prophylactic penicillin therapy. All 7 children had an acute febrile illness and rapid deterioration despite parenterally administered antibiotic therapy and intensive medical support. Erythrocyte pit counts in 2 patients were 40.3 and 41.7%, respectively (normal, less than 3.6%). Autopsy findings in 5 cases included splenic congestion without infarction in 5, splenomegaly in 4, and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage in 3. Lane et al. (1994) concluded that pneumococcal vaccine should be administered in all children with SC disease. The routine use of prophylactic penicillin therapy in infants and children with SC disease remained controversial. \n\nMorris et al. (1991) reported hematologic findings in 181 patients, aged 40 to 73 years, with hemoglobin SS disease. The studies showed a downward age-related trend in hemoglobin and platelets and falling reticulocyte count consistent with progressive bone marrow failure which could not be explained by renal impairment. Kodish et al. (1991) concluded that despite current rates of mortality and morbidity with bone marrow transplantation, a substantial minority of parents of children with sickle cell disease would consent to bone marrow transplantation for their children. \n\nAdams (1995) reviewed the literature on sickle cell disease and stroke. Previous studies had shown clinically evident cerebral vascular disease in 7 to 8% of cohorts followed during the first 2 weeks of life. However, MRI series demonstrated 11 to 24% of cerebral vascular accidents in patients with sickle cell disease, indicating a large proportion of silent infarctions. \n\nThe defect in urine concentrating ability in persons with sickle cell trait is thought to result from intracellular polymerization of Hb S in erythrocytes, leading to microvascular occlusion, in the vasa recta of the renal medulla. Reasoning that the severity of the concentration defect might be related to the percentage of sickle hemoglobin present in erythrocytes, Gupta et al. (1991) studied urine concentrating ability in 3 classes of A/S individuals, those with a normal alpha-globin genotype and those who were either heterozygous or homozygous for the gene-deletion type of alpha-thalassemia. They found a correlation between urine concentrating ability and the percentage of sickle hemoglobin, which was highest in the individuals with normal alpha-globin genotype and lowest in those homozygous for the deletion. \n\nSteinberg (1989) described a 73-year-old black man in Mississippi who had hematologically and genotypically typical sickle cell anemia with, however, very mild clinical manifestations. He had had cholecystectomy for asymptomatic cholelithiasis at the age of about 47. He had had partial priapism. In a large study involving 2,590 patients over 5 years of age at entry and followed for an average of 5.6 years, Milner et al. (1991) found an overall prevalence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head of about 10%. Patients with the hemoglobin SS genotype and alpha-thalassemia and those with frequent painful crises were at highest risk. Osteonecrosis was found in patients as young as 5 years old. \n\nSteinberg et al. (1995) presented 5 cases of sickle cell anemia in individuals in their 70s. They concluded that 'We do not understand why some patients with sickle cell anemia survive their peers by decades just as we have little insight into why occasional normal individuals live far beyond the average number of years.' Sickle cell patients that express gamma-globin at 10 to 20% of the level of sickle globin in most of their red blood cells have greatly improved clinical prognoses (Lan et al., 1998). \n\nLangdown et al. (1989) described a doubly substituted sickling hemoglobin, called HbS (Oman) (141900.0245). The higher expressors of HbS (Oman) had a sickle cell anemia clinical syndrome of moderate intensity, whereas the lower expressors had no clinical syndrome and were comparable to the solitary case first described in Oman. \n\nPopp et al. (1997) stated that the sickle cell anemia syndrome produced by HbS Antilles (141900.0244) is a more severe phenotype than that produced by HbS. Humans heterozygous for HbS have RBCs that contain approximately 40% HbS, but do not exhibit clinical symptoms of sickle cell disease. In comparison, humans heterozygous for HbS Antilles have RBCs that contain approximately 40% HbS Antilles, but these individuals exhibit clinical symptoms of sickle cell disease that are similar in severity to those in persons who are homozygous for HbS. This is because Hb S Antilles is less soluble and has a right shift in its oxygen association-dissociation curve, properties that favor deoxygenation and polymerization of Hb S Antilles. \n\nRey et al. (1991) described sickle cell/hemoglobin E (SE) disease (141900.0071) in 3 black American children of Haitian origin. They pointed out that the disorder is probably more benign than SC disease, SC (Arab) disease (141900.0202), and SC (Harlem) disease (141900.0039), all of which have increased risk of the complications of sickling including pneumococcal sepsis. \n\nWalker et al. (2000) studied the prevalence, incidence, risk factors, clinical associations, and morbidity of gallstones in 311 patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and 167 patients with sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease in a cohort studied from birth. Gallstones developed in 96 patients with hemoglobin SS disease and 18 patients with SC disease; specific symptoms necessitating cholecystectomy occurred in only 7 patients with homozygous SS disease. \n\nAdler et al. (2001) described a patient with mild HbSC disease who, after administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF; 138970) for collection of peripheral stem cells, developed sickle cell crisis and died within 36 hours. The case strongly suggested a role for granulocytes in acute sickle cell complications and a need for caution in the use of GCSF in this disorder. The patient was a 47-year-old African American woman who had learned she had HbSC disease only 6 weeks earlier. She had no history of sickle cell crisis. HbSC disease was diagnosed after a hemoglobinopathy evaluation at the time of HLA typing, done in preparation for her to become a stem cell donor for her sister, who had chronic myeloid leukemia and mild HbSC disease. The patient was the only sib and had a 6 of 6 antigen match. \n\nThomas et al. (2000) presented growth curves for children aged 0-18 years with homozygous sickle cell disease. These were derived from 315 participants in a longitudinal cohort study in Kingston, Jamaica. \n\nAshley-Koch et al. (2001) performed population-based surveillance of children aged 3 to 10 years from metropolitan Atlanta to determine if stroke-related neurologic damage in children with sickle cell disease is associated with developmental disabilities. Children with sickle cell disease had an increased risk for developmental disabilities of 3.2, with a P value of less than 0.0001, particularly mental retardation (RR = 2.7, P = 0.0005) and cerebral palsy (RR = 10.8, P less than 0.0001). This risk was confined to developmental disabilities associated with stroke (RR = 130, P less than 0.0001; for developmental disabilities without stroke the relative risk was only 1.3 with a P value of 0.23). \n\nGladwin et al. (2004) demonstrated that pulmonary hypertension, diagnosed by doppler echocardiography, is common in adults with sickle cell disease. It appears to be a complication of chronic hemolysis, is resistant to hydroxyurea therapy, and confers a high risk of death. \n\nPriapism, although uncommon in the general population, is one of the most serious complications associated with sickle cell disease. Nolan et al. (2005) assembled 273 patients with sickle cell disease and priapism and 979 control subjects with sickle cell disease and no priapism. Case subjects, compared with controls, had significantly lower hemoglobin levels, higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, and aspartate aminotransferase, and higher reticulocyte, white blood cell, and platelet counts. The findings suggested an association of priapism with increased hemolysis. Hemolysis decreases the availability of circulating nitric oxide, which plays an important role in erectile function. \n\nGladwin (2005) discussed the hemolytic subphenotype of sickle cell disease. He pointed out that hemolytic anemia, while silent from a vasoocclusive pain crisis standpoint, leads to sustained nitric oxide depletion, oxidant stress, vasoconstriction, and proliferative vasculopathy in a number of organ systems, ultimately contributing to the development of priapism, cutaneous leg ulceration, pulmonary hypertension, sudden death, and possibly stroke.\n\nIn a Jamaican study, Serjeant et al. (1968) described 60 patients with homozygous sickle cell disease who were 30 years of age or older, and Platt et al. (1994) estimated a median survival of 42 to 48 years. Serjeant et al. (2007) stated that the sickle cell clinic at the University of West Indies had treated 102 patients (64.7% women) who survived beyond their 60th birthday. None of the patients received hydroxyurea, and only 2 patients with renal impairment received regular transfusions. The ages of the patients ranged from 60.2 to 85.6 years. Measurement of fetal hemoglobin levels suggested that higher fetal hemoglobin levels probably conferred protection in childhood. The major clinical problems emerging with age were renal impairment and decreased levels of hemoglobin.",
				"Diagnosis": "Prenatal Diagnosis\n\nAs a preliminary step to preimplantation diagnosis of sickle cell disease in unfertilized eggs or 8-cell embryos of heterozygous parents, Monk et al. (1993) established quality control by detection of the mutant and normal alleles of the HBB gene using single buccal cells. Efficient PCR amplification of a 680-bp sequence of the HBB gene spanning the site of the HbS mutation was obtained for 79% of single heterozygous cells. In 71% of cases, both alleles were detected. Monk et al. (1993) predicted that with that level of efficiency, a clinical preimplantation diagnosis at the 8-cell embryo stage could be carried out safely and reliably for a couple at risk of transmitting sickle cell disease to their children. \n\nAs a substitute for obtaining fetal cells for genetic diagnosis by the invasive procedures of amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, and fetal blood sampling, Cheung et al. (1996) reported a method for detecting point mutations in single gene disorders by enriching fetal cells from maternal blood by magnetic cell sorting followed by isolation of pure fetal cells by microdissection. In 2 pregnancies at risk for sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia, they successfully identified the fetal genotypes. \n\nXu et al. (1999) performed preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for sickle cell anemia on 7 embryos produced by in vitro fertilization for a couple who were both carriers of the sickle cell gene. PGD indicated that 4 were normal and 2 were carriers; diagnosis was not possible in 1. The embryos were transferred to the uterus on the fourth day after oocyte retrieval. A twin pregnancy was confirmed by ultrasonography, and subsequent amniocentesis showed that both fetuses were unaffected and were not carriers of the sickle cell mutation. The patient delivered healthy twins at 39 weeks' gestation. ",

		"AKA": "AKA: MFS, MFS1",
		"Contents": [
			{
				"Description": "A heritable disorder of fibrous connective tissue, Marfan syndrome shows striking pleiotropism and clinical variability. The cardinal features occur in 3 systems--skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular. It shares overlapping features with congenital contractural arachnodactyly, which is caused by mutation in the FBN2 gene.",
				"History": "Marfan (1896) first described the skeletal features of this disorder in a 5.5-year-old girl, Gabrielle P. He referred to the condition as dolichostenomelia (long, thin limbs). Hecht and Beals (1972) thought that this condition was in fact CCA. The association of ectopia lentis was reported by Boerger (1914). A systematic review of the literature by Ruettimann and Steinmann (1996) revealed that the eponymic designation was first proposed by Carrau (1929) who explained why the terms dolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, acromacria, and hyperchondroplasia were incomplete and unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the 1950s studies of a relatively large number of patients and their families delineated the natural history of the Marfan syndrome, particularly the cardiovascular complications (McKusick, 1955), defined the range of pleiotropism and variability, and established its autosomal dominant inheritance.\n\nBecause the disorder was expressed in the heterozygote, a unitary defect of a structural, nonenzymic element of connective tissue seemed likely. In 1956, it was possible to write (McKusick, 1956): 'What the suspensory ligament of the lens has in common with the media of the aorta is obscure. If [this were known], the basic defect of the [Marfan] syndrome might be understood.' Indeed, the abundance of fibrillin in the suspensory ligament as well as in the periosteum of bone and the aortic media was a key factor in focusing attention on that connective tissue protein (McKusick, 1991).",
				"Clinical Features": "Increased height, disproportionately long limbs and digits, anterior chest deformity, mild to moderate joint laxity, vertebral column deformity (scoliosis and thoracic lordosis), and a narrow, highly arched palate with crowding of the teeth are frequent skeletal features. Sponseller et al. (1995) evaluated spinal deformity in 113 patients with Marfan syndrome, 82 of whom were skeletally immature. Scoliosis was found in 52 of the 82 patients, with equal prevalence for the sexes. The thoracic portion of the curve was convex to the right in all but 2 patients. \n\nWestling et al. (1998) quantitated the craniofacial morphology through evaluation of dental casts and lateral cephalograms in 76 Marfan patients. About 70% of the patients had been referred for orthodontic treatment, mostly because of crowded teeth or extreme maxillary overjet (overbite). The appearance of the palatal vault, crowded teeth, and overbite were illustrated. \n\nMyopia, increased axial globe length, corneal flatness, and subluxation of the lenses (ectopia lentis) are ocular findings (Pyeritz and McKusick, 1979). Of 573 patients with Marfan syndrome, Izquierdo et al. (1994) found that 110 (19.2%) had strabismus; exotropia occurred in 67 (11.7%), esotropia in 12 (2.1%), vertical deviations in 8 (1.4%), and primary inferior oblique muscle overaction in 3 (0.5%). \n\nMitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation, dilatation of the aortic root, and aortic regurgitation are cardiovascular features. The major life-threatening cardiovascular complications--aneurysm of the aorta and aortic dissection--were reported in single cases by Baer et al. (1943) and Etter and Glover (1943). About one-third of affected persons have mitral valve prolapse, aortic root enlargement, or both on echocardiography, despite normal auscultatory findings on cardiac examination (Brown et al., 1975; Pyeritz and McKusick, 1979). \n\nOther common or peculiar manifestations include striae distensae, pulmonary blebs (which predispose to spontaneous pneumothorax), and spinal arachnoid cysts or diverticula (Weir, 1973; Newman and Tilley, 1979; Cilluffo et al., 1981). By CT scanning, Pyeritz et al. (1988) found widening of the lumbosacral spinal canal (dural ectasia) in 36 of 57 patients with the Marfan syndrome and in none of 57 age- and sex-matched non-Marfan control patients. Severe changes were present in 13 patients, 2 of whom had associated neurologic signs, and included meningoceles or near-total erosion of a pedicle. \n\nYellin et al. (1991) described a father and 2 sons with multiple and bilateral episodes of pneumothorax. \n\nFattori et al. (1999) studied the frequency of dural ectasia in the Marfan syndrome, this feature having been classified as a major diagnostic criterion by Beighton et al. (1988) and De Paepe et al. (1996). MRI studies of the thoracic aorta and lumbosacral spine were performed in 83 patients with Marfan syndrome; 12 patients were younger than 18 years. The control group consisted of 100 individuals who underwent MRI of the lumbar spine for routine clinical indications; none of them had any potential causes for dural ectasia. Dural ectasia was identified in 76 (92%) patients and none of the control group. The severity of dural ectasia was related to age; the mean (SD) age of patients with mild dural ectasia was 26 years (14), whereas that of those with severe disease (meningocele) was 36 years (9) (p = 0.038). Dural ectasia was present in 11 of 12 patients younger than 18 years. No association was found between aortic dilatation and dural ectasia. \n\nAhn et al. (2000) studied dural ectasia in 32 volunteers with Marfan syndrome as diagnosed by the Ghent criteria (De Paepe et al., 1996). They concluded that MRI and CT diagnosed dural ectasia with high specificity and sensitivity, and suggested criteria for the diagnosis in adult Marfan patients. \n\nVan den Berg et al. (1996) surveyed 135 patients with Marfan syndrome and found none that presented with the symptomatic intracranial aneurysm. \n\nMorse et al. (1990) reported experience with 22 severely affected infants in whom the diagnosis of the Marfan syndrome was made in the first 3 months of life and reviewed the cases of 32 previously reported infants. They pointed out that serious cardiac abnormalities as well as congenital contractures may be present at birth. The most severely affected cases appear to be due to sporadic mutation; familial cases have milder manifestations which render them more difficult to detect during infancy. \n\nBuntinx et al. (1991) described severe Marfan syndrome in a neonate with aortic dilatation and cardiac valve insufficiency who died from heart failure at 20 hours of age. Cardiomegaly and aortic dilatation had been noted at 35 weeks' gestation by means of routine ultrasonography. While the occurrence of contractures in the severe neonatal form raised a question about the distinctness of congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA; 121050) from Marfan syndrome, CCA has now been linked to the gene encoding fibrillin-2 (612570) on chromosome 5. The contractures tend to resolve with time. ",
				"Diagnosis": "",
				"Cytogenetics": "",
				"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations": "Attias et al. (2009) compared clinical features and outcomes of 71 patients with TGFBR2 (190182) mutations to those of 243 patients with FBN1 mutations. Aortic dilation was present in a similar proportion of patients in both the TGFBR2 and FBN1 groups (78% and 79%, respectively) but was highly variable; the incidence and average age for thoracic aortic surgery and aortic dissection were also similar in the 2 groups. Mitral valve involvement was less frequent in the TGFBR2 than in the FBN1 group (p less than 0.05 for myxomatous valve, prolapse, or mitral regurgitation). Aortic dilation, dissection, or sudden death was the index event leading to genetic diagnosis in 65% of families with TGFBR2 mutations versus 32% with FBN1 mutations (p = 0.002). The rate of death was greater in TGFBR2 families before diagnosis, but similar once the disease was recognized. Most pregnancies were uneventful in both groups. Seven (10%) of the 71 patients with TGFBR2 mutations fulfilled the Ghent criteria for Marfan syndrome, including 2 with ectopia lentis, compared with 140 (58%) of 243 patients in the FBN1 group (p less than 0.0001); 3 patients in the TGFBR2 group fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for both Loeys-Dietz (see 610168) and Marfan syndromes. Noting that clinical outcomes were similar between treated patients from both groups, Attias et al. (2009) concluded that prognosis depends on clinical disease expression and treatment rather than simply the presence of a TGFBR2 mutation. \n\nUsing DNA samples from 300 patients with clinical features of MFS or a related phenotype that had been previously screened by DHPLC with no mutations found in the FBN1 gene, Hilhorst-Hofstee et al. (2011) performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and identified 9 patients from 5 families with deletion of 1 entire FBN1 allele. A tenth patient with complete deletion of FBN1 was identified by cytogenetic analysis and array CGH. All of the patients had facial and skeletal features of MFS, and 7 of the 10 patients fulfilled the Ghent criteria; the 3 patients who did not present the full clinical picture of MFS were young (5, 8, and 13 years of age, respectively). Aortic root dilation was present in 6 patients, 2 of whom underwent surgical repair at relatively young ages. Hilhorst-Hofstee et al. (2011) concluded that complete loss of 1 FBN1 allele does not predict a mild phenotype, and that their findings support the hypothesis that true haploinsufficiency can lead to the classic phenotype of Marfan syndrome. \n"

		"Title": "Fragile X Syndrome",
		"Entry": "OMIM Entry: #300624",
		"AKA": "AKA: Macroorchidism, Martin-Bell Syndrome",
		"Contents": [
			{
				"Description": "Fragile X syndrome is characterized by moderate to severe mental retardation, macroorchidism, and distinct facial features, including long face, large ears, and prominent jaw. In most cases, the disorder is caused by the unstable expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene and abnormal methylation, which results in suppression of FMR1 transcription and decreased protein levels in the brain.",
				"History": "The X-linked mental retardation reported by Martin and Bell (1943) is the same as the fragile X syndrome. Opitz et al. (1984) referred to this disorder as the 'Martin-Bell syndrome' on the assumption that the family reported from the Queen Square Hospital in London by J. Purdon Martin and Julia Bell (Martin and Bell, 1943) had that disorder. Although macroorchidism was not mentioned by Martin and Bell (1943), one of the patients was described as having a 'big face and jaw;' furthermore, at least 9 of the affected males were maternal grandsons of 2 unaffected brothers. All but 1 of the mothers of affected males were daughters of these 2 brothers, the other being their sister. Martin and Bell (1943) hypothesized that some controlling factor caused suppression of the disease in the 2 grandfathers without affecting their liability to transmit it. For a superb biography of Julia Bell (1879-1979), see Bundey (1996).\n\nRichards et al. (1981) followed up on the Martin-Bell kindred, demonstrating that it was indeed the fragile X syndrome. The original index patient was then aged 56. All 4 affected males who had adequate karyotyping showed the fragile X syndrome in 17 to 50% of their cells. The other major contribution of Julia Bell was in the defining of many hereditary disorders, such as the forms of brachydactyly, on the basis of massive collections of pedigrees in the famous Treasury of Human Inheritance. She also collaborated with J. B. S. Haldane in the first estimation of linkage in the human, that of colorblindness and hemophilia (Bell and Haldane, 1937).\n\nAccording to Opitz and Sutherland (1984), Escalante, a graduate student with Frota-Pessoa in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Drs. Bryan and Gillian Turner in Sydney, Australia, independently noted the association of macroorchidism with X-linked mental retardation in the late 1960s. Escalante et al. (1971) published their findings (which they had reported in 1969 at the Warsaw Congress of the International Association for the Scientific Study of Mental Deficiency) in the Journal de Genetique Humaine. While visiting the Drs. Turner in Sydney, McKusick (1970) examined several patients with mental retardation and macroorchidism.",
				"Clinical Features": "Lubs (1969) reported a family in which 4 males spanning 3 generations had mental retardation. Cytogenetic studies showed an unusual constriction of the long arm of the X chromosome in 10 to 33% of cells. In a follow-up report of the same family, Lubs et al. (1984) noted that affected individuals had large testes, low-set large ears, and asymmetric facial features with prominent angle of the jaw. \n\nCantu et al. (1976) reported 4 male sibs with congenital bilateral macroorchidism and severe mental retardation. Detailed endocrinologic evaluation, including sperm analysis, indicated normal testicular function. \n\nMattei et al. (1981) reported 20 patients from 15 unrelated families with fragile X syndrome. In all 19 affected male and 1 affected female proband, the fragile X site was detected in 10-61% of lymphocyte or fibroblast cells; there seemed to be no correlation between the frequency of the fragile site and clinical severity. Three sisters of probands were mildly affected, but carrier females were unaffected. Affected male individuals showed characteristic facies, including long face, high forehead, midface hypoplasia, large mouth with long upper middle incisors, thick lips, high-arched palate, large jaw with prominent chin, and large, poorly formed ears. None of 14 prepubertal males showed macroorchidism. Mental retardation was very variable, but language development was usually very delayed. Motor development was often delayed. Most showed unusual behavior, with alternating anxiety and hilarity, disordered hyperactivity, and aggressiveness. \n\nLubs et al. (1984) reported a large African American kindred in which 10 males had mental retardation and macroorchidism associated with the abnormal X chromosome marker. Other variable clinical features included asymmetric facies and large hands. Six females were similarly affected. Meryash et al. (1984) studied 18 affected males, aged 18 to 69 years. Of 15 subjects, 13 had macroorchidism. Average height was less than published standards. Of the 18 subjects, 17 had absolute or relative macrocephaly and 12 were dolichocephalic. \n\nJacobs (1982) encountered a man and Daker et al. (1981) reported 2 brothers with marXq28 and average intelligence. Similarly, Fryns and Van Den Berghe (1982) presented a kindred in which the fragile X chromosome was transmitted by at least 3 normal males. These men died at ages 68, 72, and 76 years and had a normal phenotype with normal intelligence; one was an administrator and 2 were officers. Voelckel et al. (1988) reported 3 brothers with the fragile X; only 2 were mentally retarded. Johnson et al. (1991) described a large kindred with 10 mentally retarded, fragile X-positive males, and 2 normal transmitting males. Pellissier et al. (1991) also described a kindred with 2 normal transmitter brothers. \n\nLoesch and Hay (1988) presented the clinical findings on 113 fragile X female heterozygotes from 44 families. In 85% of a subsample of 92 adult females, the nonverbal IQ score was 85 or less. Verbal ability deficits were much less common. Typical facial characteristics, irregular teeth, and hypermobility of finger joints occurred in approximately 40% of adult females, but facial abnormalities were less common in children. Although the frequency of miscarriages was increased, a moderate increase in the number of children was found in female carriers with borderline intellectual impairment. The question of whether ovarian size is increased in females with the fragile X was addressed by Goodman et al. (1987). \n\nA Prader-Willi-like subphenotype of the fragile X syndrome was described by de Vries et al. (1993). Clinical features included extreme obesity with a full, round face, small, broad hands and feet, and regional skin hyperpigmentation. Unlike the Prader-Willi syndrome (176270), the patients lacked the neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems during infancy followed by hyperphagia during toddlerhood. In a group of 26 patients with suspected Prader-Willi syndrome but without detectable molecular abnormalities of chromosome 15, one fragile X patient was found. General overgrowth was described in 4 fragile X patients, all of whom came from families with other affected relatives who showed the classic Martin-Bell phenotype (de Vries et al., 1995). Schrander-Stumpel et al. (1994) found the FMR1 mutation in a 3-year-old boy with unexplained extreme obesity and delayed motor and speech development. They compared the clinical features with those in 9 reported patients with the fragile X syndrome and extreme obesity. They suggested that behavioral characteristics such as hyperkinesis, autistic-like behavior, and apparent speech and language deficits may help point toward the diagnosis of the fragile X syndrome. \n\nLimprasert et al. (2000) described unilateral macroorchidism in a boy with fragile X syndrome and discussed the possible explanations. \n\nBackes et al. (2000) evaluated a group of boys with fragile X syndrome, ascertained by molecular genetic methods, to determine a cognitive and behavioral profile. The cognitive phenotype revealed a general intelligence corresponding to mild to moderately severe mental retardation. Psychiatric comorbidity was high, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder, enuresis, and encopresis predominated. No significant correlation between the specific features of the phenotype and genotype were found. ",
				"Diagnosis": "Jacky and Dill (1980) detected the fragile X chromosome in cultured lymphocytes and fibroblasts from affected patients. Glover (1981), Tommerup et al. (1981), and Jacobs et al. (1982) demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of thymidylate synthetase (TYMS; 188350) was effective in inducing the fragile X marker in cell cultures. Snyder et al. (1984) showed that culture conditions that promote expression of the fragile X site do not affect expression of lymphocyte HPRT but do cause a marked reduction in G6PD activity. \n\nSutherland (1989) indicated that there is a fragile site (FRAXD) located at Xq27.2, separate from the classic FRAXA site at Xq27.3 which is responsible for mental retardation. The FRAXD is inducible by high doses of aphidicolin. Ramos et al. (1992) concluded that the fragile site at Xq27.2 can be demonstrated in normal persons under the conditions of thymidylate stress routinely used for cytogenetic diagnosis of the fragile X syndrome. Furthermore, this fragile site is present at low levels (1-2%) in all persons who express it and, therefore, its expression is unlikely to cause false-positive diagnoses of the syndrome. Lesions at Xq26 are also seen at low levels in lymphocytes of persons without the syndrome. \n\nGriffiths and Strachan (1991) described a technique, based on a culture system reported by Wheater and Roberts (1987), that enabled the cytogeneticist to do fra(X) screening and prometaphase banding on the same specimen. \n\nUsing restriction enzymes, Oberle et al. (1991) detected abnormally large-sized fragments and abnormal methylation around the fragile X site in affected males and carrier females. Some affected males appeared to be mosaics, with coexistence of a large methylated fragment and a smaller normal unmethylated fragment. Rare apparent false negatives were considered to be the result of genetic heterogeneity or misdiagnosis. \n\nRousseau et al. (1991) concluded that direct DNA diagnosis of the fragile X syndrome is efficient and reliable. Southern analysis of EcoRI and EagI digests of DNA distinguished clearly in a single test between the normal genotype, the premutation, and the full mutation. All 103 affected males and 31 of 59 females with full mutations had mental retardation. Fifteen percent of those with full mutations had some cells carrying only the premutation. All of the mothers of affected children were carriers of either a premutation or a full mutation. Because of the certainty of DNA diagnosis, this method replaced cytogenetic detection of the fragile X chromosome, which carries a rate of misdiagnosis of about 5% for both false positives and the more frequent false negative conclusion, and diagnosis by the linkage principle, which gives a probabilistic result rather than an absolute one. Jacobs (1991), however, stated that the cytogenetic marker still had an honorable role to play in the diagnosis of fragile X syndrome. It was reliable for virtually all males and for the majority of affected females and was the most efficient and cost effective methodology at that time. \n\nMandel et al. (1992) reported on the Fifth International Workshop on the Fragile X and X-Linked Mental Retardation held near Strasbourg, France, in August 1991. In addition to their summary, over 50 papers on the fragile X syndrome and 18 papers related to other X-linked mental retardation syndromes presented at the conference were published in the American Journal of Medical Genetics. Mandel et al. (1992) reviewed the hypothesis of Patricia Jacobs which postulated 3 mutations: a change from a normal insert (N) to a small insert that is at low risk of converting to a large insert (S); a change from that type of small insert to a small insert at high risk of converting to a large insert (S*); and a change from the high risk small insert to a large insert (L) which is associated with clinical abnormality. Cytogenetic screening of the mentally handicapped for the fra(X) was equivalent to testing for individuals with a large insert (L) as there was no evidence that a small insert (S) has a deleterious effect on the phenotype. The consensus was that in diagnostic laboratories cytogenetics is still the method of choice, with subsequent molecular investigation of those patients found or suspected of being fra(X) positive; no consensus was reached on the relative merits of cytogenetics and molecular techniques for screening. Mulley et al. (1992) reported a high success rate with the direct molecular diagnosis of fragile X using the pfxa3 probe which detects amplification of an unstable DNA element consisting of variable length CCG repeats. \n\nSnow et al. (1993) found that PCR followed by DNA sequencing of the FMR1 gene allowed the most accurate determination of CGG repeat numbers up to approximately 130 repeats. Turner et al. (1996) suggested that the clinical definition of fragile X syndrome be redefined in males as a mental handicap associated with absolute or relative deficiency of the FMR1 protein. In the absence of a readily available protein test, analysis of the trinucleotide repeat size has been used for diagnosis. An increase in the size of the trinucleotide repeat over a particular value initiates methylation of the FMR gene promoter site and suppression of FMR1 gene transcription. Testing can identify individuals who lack FMR1 protein as a consequence of deletion of the gene but will not identify those individuals whose FMR1 protein is defective through mutation. \n\nWillemsen et al. (1995, 1997) developed a diagnostic method using mouse monoclonal antibodies against the FMR1 protein that allowed for detection of the fragile X syndrome in a blood smear. This noninvasive test required only 1 or 2 drops of blood and could be used to screen large groups of mentally retarded persons and neonates. Willemsen et al. (1999) modified the antibody test for application to hair roots. Mentally retarded female patients with a full mutation showed FMR protein expression in only some of their hair roots (less than 55%), and no overlap with normal female controls was observed. \n\nStorm et al. (1998) noted that incomplete EcoRI digestion may lead to false diagnosis of fragile X syndrome and suggested that HindIII digest be used instead of EcoRI to identify premutation vs normal fragment length in genomic DNA. \n\nAbrams et al. (1999) examined olfactory neuroblasts from 2 mentally retarded, autistic brothers with fragile X expansion mutations in leukocytes. Olfactory neurons were chosen for study because they are accessible neurons that undergo regeneration and are closely linked to the brain. In both subjects, the genotype in neuroblasts was highly, but not perfectly, consistent with that observed in leukocytes. The results suggested that FMR1 mutation patterns in leukocytes are a good, albeit potentially fallible, reflection of such patterns in the brain and demonstrated the feasibility of using olfactory neuron samples to evaluate FMR1 mutations in humans in vivo. \n\nStoll (2001) presented 11 children under the age of 8 years and noted the difficulties in diagnosis of fragile X syndrome at this age. The author emphasized the importance of fragile X DNA testing in all children with mental retardation, autism, or significant developmental delay without a clear etiology. \n\nMacKenzie et al. (2006) reported a 46-year-old male patient with a typical fragile X syndrome phenotype who was found to be a somatic mosaic for the FMR1 repeat expansion. Analysis of peripheral blood detected a premutation allele of 58 CGG repeats, whereas skin fibroblasts yielded a full mutation allele of 500 CGG repeats. The authors suggested that the proband may have inherited a full mutation that has undergone selective contraction, given his age at molecular diagnosis. MacKenzie et al. (2006) concluded that testing of ectodermally derived tissues may provide improved diagnosis for fragile X syndrome. \n\nCoffee et al. (2009) reported the development of an assay for newborn screening of fragile X syndrome. The assay showed 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity for detecting FMR1 methylation on dried blood spots, thus successfully distinguishing normal males from those with the full mutation. The assay could also detect excess FMR1 methylation in 82% of females with full mutations, although the methylation status did not correlate with intellectual disability. With amelogenin PCR used for detecting the presence of a Y chromosome, this assay also detected males with Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY). Among 64 males with FMR1 methylation, 7 were found to have full-mutation fragile X syndrome and 57 had Klinefelter syndrome. In their study of 36,124 newborn males, Coffee et al. (2009) estimated the incidence of fragile X syndrome to be 1 in 5,161 newborn males, and that of Klinefelter syndrome to be 1 in 633. \n\nCarrier Females\n\nToledano-Alhadef et al. (2001) tested 14,334 Israeli women of childbearing age for fragile X carrier status between 1992 and 2000. These women were either preconceptional or pregnant and had no family history of mental retardation. They identified 207 carriers of an allele with more than 50 repeats, representing a prevalence of 1:69. There were 127 carriers with more than 54 repeats, representing a prevalence of 1:113. Three asymptomatic women carried the full-mutation allele. Among the premutation and full-mutation carriers, 177 prenatal diagnoses were performed. Expansion occurred in 30 fetuses, 5 of which had an expansion to the full mutation. The authors recommended wide-scale screening to identify female carriers. \n\nIn 34 female full mutation carriers and unaffected female control relatives, Willemsen et al. (2003) found a correlation between cognitive function and the percentage of hair roots that expressed the FMRP protein. Cognitive function in the female carriers was much more strongly determined by the absence of FMRP than by genetic background. ",
				"Cytogenetics": "Lubs (1969) first described an abnormality of the distal long arm of the X chromosome, Xq, in 4 mentally retarded males from a single family. A secondary constriction of the chromosome gave the appearance of large satellites. Lubs (1969) suggested that either the anomalous region itself or a closely linked recessive gene might account for X-linked mental retardation. This observation went unconfirmed for years until cytogeneticists reverted to a folate-deficient medium for tissue culture such as Lubs (1969) employed. Appearance of this secondary constriction, referred to as a 'fragile site,' was localized to Xq27-q28 and was shown to be dependent on folate deficiency in the culture medium, which leads to deficiency of thymidine monophosphate (Giraud et al., 1976; Harvey et al., 1977; Sutherland, 1977). Sutherland was in Melbourne when he made his initial observations on the fragile X. When he went to Adelaide, he upgraded his laboratory, changing from 199 to F10 culture medium to give better chromosomes for banding. The failure to find the fragile X with the new medium led to his discovery of the critical role of folate (Gerald, 1983). \n\nAt least 12 other heritable secondary constrictions ('fragile sites') on other chromosomes were proved by the early 1980s (Sutherland, 1981; Hecht et al., 1982), but none had an association with a particular phenotype. In all pedigrees of marXq28 studied, no crossing-over between the marker and mental retardation had occurred. This suggested that the marker, rather than being closely linked to a gene causing mental retardation, is a direct cytologic indicator of the genetic mutation causing this phenotype (Kaiser-McCaw et al., 1980). \n\nTurner et al. (1978) suggested labeling the marker 'secondary constriction Xq27'; however, convention requires that 'a break suspected at an interface between two bands is identified arbitrarily by the higher of the two band numbers' (ISCN, 1978; section 2.4.4.2). Brookwell and Turner (1983) again concluded that the fragile site is in band Xq27, close to the q27-q28 interface. \n\nLubs (1969) and Martin et al. (1980) found that the fragile X marker was not preferentially inactivated in female heterozygotes. \n\nIn a survey of retarded females who had no obvious physical abnormalities, Turner et al. (1980) found that 7% expressed marXq28 in lymphocytes. Among obligate heterozygotes, the likelihood of detecting marXq28 correlated with severity of retardation (Howard-Peebles and Stoddard, 1980; Jacobs et al., 1980). In 2 heterozygous sisters who were slow learners, Uchida and Joyce (1982) found that the fragile X was active in approximately 70% of cells, whereas 2 heterozygous relatives of normal intelligence had the fragile X active in approximately 30 to 50% of cells. \n\nAn earlier suggestion that the proportion of cells exhibiting marXq28 decreases with increasing heterozygote age (Sutherland, 1979; Jacobs et al., 1980; Turner et al., 1980) may have been an artifact due to ascertaining fewer retarded women in older age groups (Jacobs et al., 1982).

		"Title": "Huntington Disease",
		"Entry": "OMIM Entry: #143100",

		"Contents": [
			{
				"Description": "Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a distinct phenotype characterized by chorea, dystonia, incoordination, cognitive decline, and behavioral difficulties. There is progressive, selective neural cell loss and atrophy in the caudate and putamen. Walker (2007) provided a detailed review of Huntington disease, including clinical features, population genetics, molecular biology, and animal models.",
				"History": "In 1872, George Huntington of Pomeroy, Ohio, wrote about a hereditary form of chorea 'which exists, so far as I know, almost exclusively on the east end of Long Island.' Osler (1893) wrote about this disorder as follows: 'Twenty years have passed since Huntingdon (sic), in a postscript to an every-day sort of article on chorea minor, sketched most graphically, in 3 or 4 paragraphs, the characters of a chronic and hereditary form which he, his father and grandfather had observed in Long Island.' As with many other conditions, Osler's writings about them brought the disorder to general attention. In a footnote, he stated: 'Several years ago I made an attempt to get information about the original family which the Huntingdons (sic) described, but their physician stated that, owing to extreme sensitiveness on the subject, the patients could not be seen.' Vessie (1932) traced the ancestry of the families studied by Huntington (1872). About 1,000 cases in 12 generations descendant from 2 brothers in Suffolk, England, could be identified. Uncertainty concerning the usual interpretation (Critchley, 1973; Maltsberger, 1961; Vessie, 1932) of the precise origin of the Huntington gene in England was voiced by Caro and Haines (1975).",
				"Clinical Features": "The classic signs of Huntington disease are progressive chorea, rigidity, and dementia. A characteristic atrophy of the caudate nucleus is seen radiographically. Typically, there is a prodromal phase of mild psychotic and behavioral symptoms which precedes frank chorea by up to 10 years. Chandler et al. (1960) observed that the age of onset was between 30 and 40 years. In a study of 196 kindreds, Reed and Neel (1959) found only 8 in which both parents of a single patient with Huntington chorea were 60 years of age or older and normal. The clinical features developed progressively with severe increase in choreic movements and dementia. The disease terminated in death on average 17 years after manifestation of the first symptoms. \n\nFolstein et al. (1984, 1985) contrasted HD in 2 very large Maryland pedigrees: an African American family residing in a bayshore tobacco farming community and a white Lutheran family living in a farming community in the western Maryland foothills and descended from an immigrant from Germany. They differed, respectively, in age at onset (33 years vs 50 years), presence of manic-depressive symptoms (2 vs 75), number of cases of juvenile onset (6 vs 0), mode of onset (abnormal gait vs psychiatric symptoms), and frequency of rigidity or akinesia (5/21 vs 1/15). In the African American family, the mean age at onset was 25 years when the father was affected and 41 years when the mother was affected; the corresponding figures in the white family were 49 and 52 years. Allelic mutations were postulated. In another survey in Maryland, Folstein et al. (1987) found that the prevalence of HD among African Americans was equal to that in whites. \n\nAdams et al. (1988) found that life-table estimates of age of onset of motor symptoms have produced a median age 5 years older than the observed mean when correction for truncated intervals of observation (censoring) was made. The bias of censoring refers to the variable intervals of observation and loss to observation at different ages. For example, gene carriers lost to follow-up, those deceased before onset of disease, and those who had not yet manifested the disease at the time of data collection were excluded from the observed distribution of age at onset. \n\nKerbeshian et al. (1991) described a patient with childhood-onset Tourette syndrome (137580) who later developed Huntington disease. \n\nShiwach (1994) performed a retrospective study of 110 patients with Huntington disease in 30 families. He found the minimal lifetime prevalence of depression to be 39%. The frequency of symptomatic schizophrenia was 9%, and significant personality change was found in 72% of the sample. The age at onset was highly variable: some showed signs in the first decade and some not until over 60 years of age. \n\nThe results of a study by Shiwach and Norbury (1994) clashed with the conventional wisdom that psychiatric symptoms are a frequent presentation of Huntington disease before the development of neurologic symptoms. They performed a control study of 93 neurologically healthy individuals at risk for Huntington disease. The 20 asymptomatic heterozygotes showed no increased incidence of psychiatric disease of any sort when compared to the 33 normal homozygotes in the same group. However, the whole group of heterozygous and homozygous normal at-risk individuals showed a significantly greater number of psychiatric episodes than did their 43 spouses, suggesting stress from the uncertainty associated with belonging to a family segregating this disorder. Shiwach and Norbury (1994) concluded that neither depression nor psychiatric disorders are likely to be significant preneurologic indicators of heterozygous expression of the disease gene. \n\nGiordani et al. (1995) performed extensive neuropsychologic evaluations on 8 genotype-positive individuals comparing them to 8 genotype-negative individuals from families with Huntington disease. They found no significant differences between these 2 groups, casting further doubt on earlier reports that suggested cognitive impairments are premonitory signs of the classical neurologic syndrome of Huntington disease. \n\nRosenberg et al. (1995) performed a double-blind study on 33 persons at risk for HD who had applied for genetic testing. Significantly inferior cognitive functioning was disclosed in gene carriers by a battery of neuropsychologic tests covering attentional, visuospatial, learning, memory, and planning functions. Primarily, attentional, learning, and planning functions were affected. \n\nBamford et al. (1995) performed a prospective analysis of neuropsychologic performance and CT scans of 60 individuals with Huntington disease. They found that psychomotor skills showed the most significant consistent decline among cognitive functions assessed. \n\nLovestone et al. (1996) described an unusual HD family in which all 4 affected members presented first with a severe psychiatric syndrome which in 3 cases was schizophreniform in nature. Two other living members with no apparent signs of motor disorder had received psychiatric treatment, 1 for schizophrenia. \n\nMochizuki et al. (1999) described a case of late-onset Huntington disease with the first symptom of dysphagia. The 61-year-old man was admitted with dysphagia and dysarthria, which had developed gradually over 2 years. The patient had no psychologic signs, dementia, paresis, involuntary movements, ataxia, or sensory disturbance in the limbs. Dysphagia and dysarthria appeared to be caused by a 'cough-like movement' just before or during speaking or swallowing. Because the 'cough-like movement' progressed for 3 years and was eventually suppressed with disappearance of dysphagia after administration of haloperidol, this symptom was thought to be due to HD. \n\nPaulsen et al. (2006) studied the brain structure of 24 preclinical HD patients as measured by brain MRI and compared them to 24 healthy control subjects matched by age and gender. Preclinical HD individuals had substantial morphologic differences throughout the cerebrum compared to controls. The volume of cerebral cortex was significantly increased in preclinical HD, whereas basal ganglion and cerebral white matter volumes were substantially decreased. Although decreased volumes of the striatum and cerebral white matter could represent early degenerative changes, the finding of an enlarged cortex suggested that developmental pathology occurs in HD. \n\nMarshall et al. (2007) compared psychiatric manifestations among 29 HD mutation carriers with no clinical symptoms, 20 HD mutation carriers with mild motor symptoms, 34 manifesting HD patients, and 171 nonmutation controls. The mild motor symptoms group and the manifesting HD group showed significantly higher scores for obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, paranoia, and psychoticism compared to the nonmutation control group. The mutation carriers without symptoms had higher scores for anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism compared to the nonmutation control group. The results indicated that individuals in the preclinical stage of HD exhibit specific psychiatric symptoms and that additional symptoms may manifest later in the disease course. Walker (2007) noted that suicidal ideation is a frequent finding in Huntington disease and that physicians should be aware of increased suicide risk both in asymptomatic at-risk patients and symptomatic patients. ",
				"Diagnosis": "Prenatal Diagnosis\n\nHarper and Sarfarazi (1985) pointed out that predictive testing can be done in prenatal diagnosis without determining the status of the at-risk parent. For example, if the affected grandparent of the fetus is deceased, the other grandparent is genotype BB, and the parent at risk is AB married to a CC individual, the fetus is unlikely to have inherited HD if it is BC, while the risk is 50% if the fetus is AC. The likelihood of the BC fetus being affected is a function of recombination. Bloch and Hayden (1987) pointed out that this 'no news' or 'good news' option has some important consequences. The 'no news' outcome increases the risk of the fetus's having inherited the gene for HD from 25% to about 50%; thus, persons given this information may need long-term support. Also, the implication of linking the status of an at-risk child to that of the at-risk parent may be more serious than realized. \n\nQuarrell et al. (1987) suggested the usefulness of the G8 marker in exclusion testing for HD. They cited studies of 52 families from various parts of the world, indicating a maximum total lod score of 75.3 at a recombination fraction of about 5 cM. The 95% confidence intervals were 2.4 and 6.5 cM, with no evidence of multilocus heterogeneity. The marker could be applied either for presymptomatic predictive testing or for exclusion testing in pregnancy, where the estimated risk to the parent is not altered. The requirements for family structure were much less stringent in the case of exclusion testing. In South Wales they found that nearly 90% of couples have the minimum structure required for an exclusion test, whereas for a presymptomatic predictive test only 15% have the ideal 3-generation family structure and only 10% have a suitably extended 2-generation family. The distribution of G8 haplotypes presented the same difficulty whichever test was being considered; only about two-thirds of couples would be informative. If the fetus acquired the G8 haplotype of the affected grandparent, then the risk to the fetus was the same as that of the parent, i.e., 50%. If the fetus has the G8 haplotype of the unaffected grandparent, then the risk to the fetus became 2.5%. If termination of pregnancy was unacceptable despite an adverse result of the test and HD subsequently developed in the parent in generation 2, it would be immediately known that HD would also be likely to arise in the offspring since their risks are the same (apart from the possibility of recombination). To prevent this complication, Quarrell et al. (1987) told couples that if termination of pregnancy was unacceptable for whatever reason, then an exclusion test would be inappropriate. \n\nMillan et al. (1989) pointed out the importance of not acquiring more information than necessary to exclude or include the diagnosis of HD in a fetus. In a family they studied, the probability of the fetus being affected, approaching 50%, could be deduced from the genotype of the fetus, the 2 parents, and the unaffected paternal grandfather of the conceptus. Genotyping of the unaffected maternal grandmother of the father refined downward somewhat (from 47 to 42%) the risk of HD in the conceptus; however, it ran the risk of making the diagnosis of HD in the father and the information was really unnecessary for genetic counseling. Information about the prenatal exclusion test for HD was given to an unselected series of couples who attended a genetic counseling clinic in Glasgow from 1986 onwards. Ten couples underwent 13 prenatal tests during this period with expressed intention of stopping a pregnancy if the results indicated a high risk (almost 50%) that the fetus carried the HD gene. Although 9 fetuses at nearly 50% risk of carrying the HD gene were identified, only 6 such pregnancies were terminated. In each of the 3 high-risk pregnancies that continued, the mother made a 'final hour' decision not to undergo the scheduled, first-trimester termination. \n\nBloch and Hayden (1990) opposed the testing of children at risk for Huntington disease and questioned the usefulness of DNA tests to support a diagnosis of HD in either adulthood or childhood. They opposed testing in adoption cases because of the negative effects on the child's upbringing and education as well as the necessity to adhere to the principle of autonomy on the part of the individual tested. Prenatal testing was undertaken in their practice only if the parents were prepared to make a decision about continuing the pregnancy on the basis of the outcome of the prenatal testing. The parents were given to understand that prenatal testing is similar to testing a minor child. In the program of Bloch and Hayden (1990), 8 exclusion prenatal tests had been performed, with 5 resulting in an increased risk for the fetus. In 4 of these, the parents decided to terminate the pregnancy. \n\nIn the experience of Tolmie et al. (1995), late reversal of a previous decision to undergo first-trimester pregnancy termination for a genetic indication was frequent among couples who had undergone the prenatal exclusion test for HD. \n\nTesting in Adults\n\nEarly results of predictive testing using D4S10 RFLPs were reported by Meissen et al. (1988). MacDonald et al. (1989) characterized genetically 5 highly informative multiallele RFLPs of value in the presymptomatic diagnosis of HD. Morris et al. (1989) and Craufurd et al. (1989) outlined problems associated with programs for presymptomatic predictive testing for HD. \n\nPositron-emission tomography (PET scanning) demonstrating loss of uptake of glucose in the caudate nuclei may be a valuable indication of affection in the presymptomatic period (Hayden et al., 1986). Hypometabolism of glucose precedes tissue loss and caudate nucleus atrophy. Mazziotta et al. (1987) used PET studies of cerebral glucose metabolism in 58 clinically asymptomatic persons at risk for HD, 10 symptomatic patients with HD, and 27 controls. They found that 31% of the persons at risk showed metabolic abnormalities of the caudate nuclei, qualitatively identical to those in the patients. Taking into account the age of each at-risk subject and the sex of the affected parent, they averaged individual risk estimates of the members of the asymptomatic group and estimated the probability of having the clinically unexpressed HD gene at 33.9% for the group--a remarkably good agreement with the percentage of metabolic abnormalities found. \n\nWiggins et al. (1992) reported on the psychologic consequences of predictive testing for HD on the basis of observations in 135 participants in the Canadian program of genetic testing. The participants were in 3 groups according to their test results: the increased-risk group (37 persons); the decreased-risk group (58 persons); and the group with no change in risk (40 persons). They showed that predictive testing had benefits for the psychologic health of persons who received results that indicated either an increase or a decrease in the risk of inheriting the gene. In an accompanying editorial, Catherine V. Hayes (1992), president of the Huntington's Disease Society of America, described what it meant to grow up as an 'at-risk' person and to have genetic testing. \n\nRead (1993) commented that the problems arising in connection with HD testing resembled those of HIV testing. The 10 years during which testing for HD required family studies have given clinical geneticists an opportunity to work out proper procedures. A great deal of effort has gone into ensuring that presymptomatic testing is always voluntary and is undertaken only after due consideration by fully informed patients. Testing of children has been firmly discouraged. It is vital that these practices should be continued. \n\nKremer et al. (1994) reported a worldwide study assessing the sensitivity and specificity of the CAG expansion as a diagnostic test. The study covered 565 families from 43 national and ethnic groups containing 1,007 patients with signs and symptoms compatible with the diagnosis of HD. Of these, 995 had an expanded CAG repeat that included from 36 to 121 repeats; sensitivity = 98.8%, with 95% confidence limits = 97.7-99.4. Included among those contributing to the sensitivity estimate were 12 patients with previously diagnosed HD in whom the number of CAG repeats was in the normal range. Reevaluation of these established that 11 had clinical features atypical of HD. In 1,581 of 1,595 control chromosomes (99.1%), the number of CAG repeats ranged from 10 to 29. The remaining 14 control chromosomes had 30 or more repeats, with 2 of these chromosomes having expansions of 37 and 39 repeats. An estimate of specificity was made from 113 subjects with other neuropsychiatric disorders with which HD is frequently confused. The number of repeats found in these disorders was similar to the number found on normal human chromosomes and showed no overlap with HD; specificity = 100%, with 95% CI = 95.5-100. The study confirmed that CAG expansion is the molecular basis of HD worldwide. ",

				"Description": "Angelman syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mental retardation, movement or balance disorder, typical abnormal behaviors, and severe limitations in speech and language. Most cases are caused by absence of a maternal contribution to the imprinted region on chromosome 15q11-q13. Prader-Willi syndrome is a clinically distinct disorder resulting from paternal deletion of the same 15q11-q13 region. In addition, the chromosome 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome shows overlapping clinical features.",
				"History": "",
				"Clinical Features": "Angelman (1965) reported 3 'puppet children,' as he called them. Angelman (1965) emphasized the abnormal cranial shape and suggested that the depressed occiput may reflect a cerebellar abnormality. (Harry Angelman pronounces his name as though it means 'male angel;' in other words, he uses a 'long a' and a 'soft g.') Bower and Jeavons (1967) coined the name 'happy puppet' syndrome for the condition that they observed in 2 patients. Clinical features included severe motor and intellectual retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, absence of speech, and unusual facies characterized by a large mandible and open-mouthed expression revealing the tongue. The French refer to the syndrome as that of the 'marionette joyeuse' (Halal and Chagnon, 1976) or 'pantin hilare' (Pelc et al., 1976). Williams and Frias (1982) suggested use of the eponym Angelman syndrome because the term 'happy puppet' may appear derisive and even derogatory to the patient's family. \n\nBerg and Pakula (1972) reported a case and reviewed those reported by Angelman (1965) and Bower and Jeavons (1967). All of the patients demonstrated excessive laughter, an occipital groove, a great facility for protruding the tongue, abnormal choroidal pigmentation, and characteristic electroencephalogram (EEG) discharges. Of the 3 patients reported by Angelman (1965), at least 1 developed optic atrophy. Two patients showed jerky movements and had trouble walking, which was believed to result from poor balance. One, a 9-year-old boy who was noticed as an infant to be 'floppy,' could take only a few steps without support. Both patients had major convulsions and showed periods of flapping their arms up and down with the elbows flexed. The EEG pattern seen in these 2 cases and in the cases of Bower and Jeavons (1967) consisted of high amplitude bilateral spike-and-wave activity which was symmetrical, synchronous, and most often monorhythmic, having a slow wave component at 2 cycles per sec. The patient reported by Berg and Pakula (1972) had an unaffected sib who also showed abnormal EEG patterns. Normal karyotype was found in the 5 patients studied. \n\nWilliams and Frias (1982) demonstrated unilateral cerebellar atrophy by CT imaging in 1 patient with AS. \n\nIn 6 of 8 children with AS, aged 3 to 10 years, Dickinson et al. (1988) found an association of striking deficiency of choroidal pigment with normal foveal reflexes. All 6 had light blue irides with normal iris architecture. All were isolated cases born to healthy, unrelated parents. The presence or absence of 15q microdeletions did not correlate with the ocular findings.\n\nIn a review of clinical features in 36 children with Angelman syndrome, Robb et al. (1989) reported global developmental delay, seizures, episodes of paroxysmal laughter, and tongue thrusting. The movement disorder consisted of a wide-based, ataxic gait with frequent jerky limb movements and flapping of the hands. \n\nFryburg et al. (1991) described the clinical features in 4 patients diagnosed at less than 2 years of age. One of their patients had oculocutaneous albinism, and all were hypopigmented compared to their first-degree relatives. All 4 had choroidal pigment hypoplasia, severe to profound global developmental delay and microcephaly of postnatal onset, seizures, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, and hyperkinesis. Clayton-Smith (1993) reported on observations concerning 82 affected individuals. All of them had absent speech or spoke less than 6 words. Thirty-nine percent were hypopigmented compared to their family members. Frequent smiling was present in 96%. King et al. (1993) concluded from the study of 6 individuals with AS that hypopigmentation characterized by light skin, reduced retinal pigment, low hairbulb tyrosinase activity, and incomplete melanization of melanosomes is part of the phenotype of AS, and is similar to that found in Prader-Willi syndrome.",
				"Diagnosis": "Boyd et al. (1988) pointed out the usefulness of the EEG in the early diagnosis of Angelman syndrome. Dorries et al. (1988) described 7 cases and concluded that the diagnosis is difficult in the first years of life. \n\nThe American Society of Human Genetics/American College of Medical Genetics Test and Technology Transfer Committee (1996) reviewed diagnostic testing for Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. \n\nStalker and Williams (1998) addressed the challenges of genetic counseling in this disorder with multiple causes. Most cases result from typical large de novo deletions of 15q11-q13 and are expected to have a low (less than 1%) risk of recurrence. AS due to paternal uniparental disomy, which occurs in the absence of a parental translocation, is likewise expected to have a recurrence risk of less than 1%. Parental transmission of a structurally or functionally unbalanced chromosome complement can lead to 15q11-q13 deletions or to UPD and will result in case-specific recurrence risks. In instances where there is no identifiable large deletion or UPD, the risk of recurrence may be as high as 50% as a result of either a maternally inherited imprinting center mutation or a mutation in the UBE3A gene. Individuals with AS who have none of the above abnormalities comprise a significant proportion of cases, and some may be at a 50% recurrence risk. Misdiagnoses can be represented in this group as well. In light of the many conditions that are clinically similar to AS, it is essential to address the possibility of diagnostic uncertainty and potential misdiagnosis before providing genetic counseling. Stalker and Williams (1998) presented an algorithmic chart summarizing the different causal classes of AS for consideration in determining recurrence risks. \n\nTekin et al. (2000) described a patient with clinical features of Angelman syndrome in whom FISH analysis revealed mosaicism for a deletion in the AS critical region, but whose methylation study results were normal. The authors recommended that FISH studies for detection of mosaicism be done in patients with clinical findings of AS even if methylation studies are normal. \n\nHall (2002) reported an apparently unique response by Angelman syndrome individuals to the vibrating tuning fork when it was held up to their ears. The response was a wide smile, often with an outburst of laughter, followed by a tendency to lean toward the vibrating tuning fork. In 6 consecutive Angelman individuals ranging in ages from 18 months to 43 years, they demonstrated a positive 'tuning fork response.' The 2 oldest individuals, aged 17 and 43 years, tended to be somewhat less demonstrative with mostly smiles and a more controlled laugh. Parents had observed their affected children as liking sound. This feature was manifested by their lying down or leaning against appliances that made a noise as if it relaxed them or made them feel good. Hall (2002) raised the possibility of the potential use of sound in intervention strategies for these individuals. Hall and Cadle (2002) described a 12-month-old child, later confirmed to have Angelman syndrome, who had a positive tuning fork response. The authors suggested that this test, if found to be positive in Angelman syndrome children at ages 2 to 12 months, may aid in the often difficult first-year diagnosis. \n\nWilliams et al. (2006) provided an updated consensus for diagnostic criteria of Angelman syndrome. The list of associated findings was expanded to include abnormal food related behaviors, obesity, constipation, and scoliosis. In addition, some patients show attraction to or fascination with water and 'crinkly' items, such as papers and plastics. Sleep disturbances include abnormal sleep-wake cycles and diminished need for sleep. \n\nThe clinical diagnosis of Angelman syndrome is based on the presence of all 4 major criteria, i.e., developmental delay, speech impairment, movement or balance disorder, and behavioral characteristics, as well as the presence of 3 of 6 minor criteria, including postnatal deceleration of head growth, seizures, abnormal EEG, sleep disturbance, attraction to or fascination with water, and drooling (summary by Tan et al., 2011). \n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n\nScheffer et al. (1990) pointed out the possible confusion with Rett syndrome. \n\nPointing out that the diagnosis of Angelman syndrome can be confirmed by a genetic laboratory in only about 80% of cases, Williams et al. (2001) reviewed several mimicking conditions, including microdeletions or microduplications. Single gene conditions include methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency (236250), Rett syndrome, alpha-thalassemia retardation syndrome (ATRX; 301040), and Gurrieri syndrome (601187). There are, in addition, symptom complexes, including cerebral palsy (see 603513), autism spectrum disorder (209850), and pervasive developmental delay (PDD), that can suggest Angelman syndrome. ",
				"Cytogenetics": "Maternal 15q Deletions and Genomic Imprinting\n\nApproximately 70% of cases of Angelman syndrome result from de novo maternal deletions involving the 15q11.2-q13 critical region (Kishino et al., 1997). \n\nMagenis et al. (1987) reported 2 unrelated girls with a deletion of the proximal part of chromosome 15q similar to that observed in Prader-Willi syndrome. However, the girls showed clinical features consistent with Angelman syndrome, including ataxia-like incoordination, frequent, unprovoked and prolonged bouts of laughter, and a facial appearance compatible with that diagnosis. None of the typical features of Prader-Willi syndrome were present. Kaplan et al. (1987) also described deletion in 15q11-q12 in a child with Angelman syndrome. Magenis et al. (1988) proposed that patients with AS and PWS share an identical deletion on chromosome 15q11. Analysis of 6 AS patients and 6 PWS patients suggested that the deletion in AS was slightly larger and also included band q12. Magenis et al. (1988) proposed that genes in band 15q12 are responsible for the greater severity of mental retardation and speech in AS, and that these genes may also suppress or alter the presumed hypothalamic abnormality that results in the uncontrolled appetite and obesity of PWS. \n\nBy molecular analyses, Donlon (1988), Williams et al. (1988), and Knoll et al. (1989) showed that similar deletions of 15q11.2 were present in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. However, whereas the deleted chromosome was of paternal origin in PWS, the deleted chromosome was of maternal origin in AS. Otherwise, the deletions in the 2 disorders were indistinguishable cytogenetically or by molecular genetic methods. The findings were interpreted as indicating imprinting of chromosomes, i.e., changes in the chromosome according to the parent of origin, with resulting consequences for early development. By high-resolution cytogenetic studies, Magenis et al. (1990) found that the same proximal band, 15q11.2, was deleted in both PWS and AS. In general, the deletion in patients with Angelman syndrome was larger, though variable, and included bands q12 and part of q13. The authors confirmed the maternal origin of the deleted chromosome in AS, contrasting with the predominant paternal origin of the deletion in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. \n\nAfter discovering 2 unrelated AS patients with a small deletion of proximal 15q, Pembrey et al. (1987, 1989) reassessed 10 further patients. Four showed a deletion within 15q11-q13, 1 showed an apparent pericentric inversion with breakpoints at 15q11 and q13 inherited from the mother, and 5 showed no discernible abnormality. Of the 5 children without discernible chromosome change, 1 had a definitely affected sib and 1 had a possibly affected sib. Of the 4 sets of parents studied, 3 had normal chromosomes, and in 1 the mother had a deletion of 15q11.2 but not 15q12. Like Pembrey et al. (1989), Fryns et al. (1989) found a visible chromosomal change in half of the patients they studied. No deletion was found in 2 affected sisters. \n\nBy flow karyotype analysis on lymphoblastoid cell lines, Cooke et al. (1989) confirmed the presence of a de novo 15q deletion in a child with Angelman syndrome. The deleted segment represented 6.1 to 9.5% of chromosome 15, or approximately 6-9.3 million basepairs. Cytogenetic evidence suggested that the deleted chromosome was derived from the smaller chromosome 15 homolog of the mother. \n\nKnoll et al. (1990) studied DNA of 19 AS patients, including 2 sib pairs, using 4 DNA markers specific to 15q11-q13. They identified 3 classes: in class I, deletion of 2 markers was detected; in class II, deletion of 1 marker; and in class III, including both sib pairs, no deletion was detected. High resolution cytogenetic data were available on 16 of the patients, and complete concordance between the presence of a cytogenetic deletion and a molecular deletion was observed. No submicroscopic deletions were detected by the DNA studies. DNA samples from the parents of 10 patients with either a class I or a class II deletion were available for study. In 7 of the 10 families, RFLPs were informative as to the parental origin of the deletion, and in all, the deleted chromosome was of maternal origin. \n\nImaizumi et al. (1990) described 6 patients, including 2 sibs, with Angelman syndrome. The 4 sporadic cases showed a microdeletion in the proximal part of 15q, whereas the affected sibs had no visible deletion. No clinical difference between the sporadic cases and the sib cases was discerned. Using 2 DNA probes that detect a molecular deletion in most patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, they found by densitometry that 2 patients had only 1 copy of each probe, whereas the other 4, including the sibs, had 2 copies of each sequence. Imaizumi et al. (1990) concluded that the segment causing AS may be different from that causing PWS. \n\nWilliams et al. (1990) studied 6 AS patients with de novo deletions of 15q11-q13. In 4 of the patients, cytogenetic studies were informative of parental origin; in all, the deletion was inherited from the mother, suggesting genomic imprinting. Malcolm et al. (1990) studied 37 typical cases. A 15q11-q13 deletion was observed in 18 of 24 isolated cases. No deletion was observed in 13 cases from 6 families with more than 1 affected child. In 11 cases it was possible to elucidate the parental origin of the deleted chromosome and these were shown to be predominantly maternal. Greenstein (1990) presented a kindred in which both the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes were found; the inheritance pattern was consistent with genetic imprinting. \n\nHulten et al. (1991) reported an extraordinary family showing segregation of a balanced translocation t(15;22)(q13;q11) and 2 cases of Prader-Willi syndrome and 1 of Angelman syndrome. It appeared that the females carrying the balanced translocation had a high risk of having children with AS, while their brothers had a high risk of having children with PWS, again indicating genomic imprinting. \n\nAll 4 AS patients described by Fryburg et al. (1991) had deletions in the 15q11.2-q13 region. Parental chromosomes were available for study in 3 of these cases; in all 3 the deleted chromosome 15 was maternally derived. Similarly, Smith et al. (1992) found the deletion of band 15q12 to be of maternal origin in all 25 cases of AS that they examined. The parental origin was determined using cytogenetic markers in 13 of the cases, by the pattern of inheritance of RFLPS in 9, and by both techniques in 3. Tonk et al. (1992) found cytogenetic deletion of 15q12 in 3 cases of AS and by heteromorphism studies showed that the deleted chromosome was maternal in all 3. \n\nChan et al. (1993) presented a series of 93 Angelman syndrome patients, showing the relative contribution of the various genetic mechanisms. Sporadic cases accounted for 81 AS patients, while 12 cases came from 6 families. Deletions in 15q11-q13 were detected in 60 cases by use of a set of highly polymorphic (CA)n repeat markers and conventional RFLPs. In 10 sporadic cases and in all 12 familial cases, no deletion was detectable. In addition, 2 cases of de novo deletions occurred in a chromosome 15 carrying a pericentric inversion. In one of these the AS child had a cousin with Prader-Willi syndrome arising from a de novo deletion in an inverted chromosome 15 inherited from his father. The other case arose from a maternal balanced t(9;15)(p24;q15) translocation. There were 3 cases of uniparental disomy. In the familial cases, all affected sibs inherited the same maternal chromosome 15 markers for the region 15q11-q13. Cytogenetic analysis detected only 42 of the 60 deletion cases. Chan et al. (1993) stated that cytogenetic analysis was still essential to detect chromosomal abnormalities other than deletions such as inversions and balanced translocations, both of which have an increased risk for deletions. \n\nTo elucidate the mechanism underlying the deletions that lead to PWS and AS, Amos-Landgraf et al. (1999) characterized the regions containing 2 proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster. Analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, YAC contigs, and FISH of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences, termed 'END' repeats, at or near the breakpoints. END-repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of the HERC2 gene (605837) (Ji et al., 1999). Many copies of the HERC2 gene are transcriptionally active in germline tissues. Amos-Landgraf et al. (1999) postulated that the END repeats flanking 15q11-q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion. Furthermore, they proposed that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells may facilitate the homologous recombination process. \n\nIn a study of 45 Finnish AS patients, Kokkonen and Leisti (2000) found 2 affected sibs, a 16-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl, in whom the diagnosis was made at 8 years and at 3 months of age, respectively. Both parents and an 18-year-old brother were healthy. The 2 sibs were found to have del(15)(q11q13); the mother's chromosomes 15 were structurally normal, whereas the patients and their unaffected brother shared an identical maternally derived haplotype outside the deletion region. These findings were suggestive of maternal germline mosaicism of del(15)(q11q13). \n\nAngelman syndrome deletions and rearrangements tend to occur at specific 'hotspots' or breakpoint (BP) clusters in proximal 15q (see Pujana et al., 2002): 2 proximal clusters, referred to as BP1 and BP2, are the breakpoints for class I and class II patients, respectively. The most common distal breakpoint, BP3, is located between markers D15S12 and D15S24. Two other breakpoint regions called BP4 and BP5 have been mapped distal to BP3, between markers D15S24 and D15S144. Gimelli et al. (2003) reported that some mothers of AS patients with deletions of the 15q11-q13 region have a heterozygous inversion involving the region that is deleted in the affected offspring. The inversion was detected in the mothers of 4 of 6 AS cases with the breakpoint 2-3 (BP2/3) 15q11-q13 deletion, but not in 7 mothers of AS cases due to paternal UPD 15. Variable inversion breakpoints were identified within breakpoint segmental duplications in the inverted AS mothers, as well as in AS deleted patients. The BP2-BP3 chromosome 15q11-q13 inversion was detected in 4 of 44 control subjects. Gimelli et al. (2003) hypothesized that the BP2/3 inversion may be an intermediate state that facilitates the occurrence of 15q11-q13 BP2/3 deletions in the offspring. \n\nApproximately one-third of Angelman patients have an imprinting defect (ID) but no imprinting center deletion, suggesting that they may mosaicism of ID cells and normal cells. In 2 patients studied, Nazlican et al. (2004) demonstrated somatic mosaicism by molecular and cellular cloning. X-inactivation studies of cloned fibroblasts from 1 patient suggested that ID occurred before the blastocyst stage. Using a quantitative methylation assay based on real-time PCR, the authors detected from less than 1% to 40% normal cells among 24 Angelman patients tested. Regression analysis suggested that patients with a higher percentage of normally methylated cells tended to have milder clinical symptoms. \n\nPaternal Uniparental Disomy\n\nApproximately 2% of cases of Angelman syndrome result from paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of 15q11-q13 (Kishino et al., 1997). \n\nMalcolm et al. (1991) found evidence of uniparental paternal disomy in 2 patients with AS. Knoll et al. (1991) examined the DNA from 10 AS patients, at least 7 of whom were familial cases, with no cytogenetic or molecular deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13. In each case, 1 maternal copy and 1 paternal copy of 15q11-q13 was observed. The authors concluded that UPD is not a frequent cause of familial AS. Engel (1991), who introduced the concept of uniparental disomy in 1980 (Engel, 1980), took Knoll et al. (1991) to task for their conclusion that uniparental disomy may be rare in this disorder and urged further studies. \n\nPaternal uniparental disomy was demonstrated by Freeman et al. (1993) in a child with a balanced 15;15 translocation. DNA polymorphisms demonstrated that the patient was homozygous at all loci for which the father was heterozygous, suggesting that the structural rearrangement was an isochromosome 15q and not a Robertsonian translocation. \n\nEngel (1993) reviewed the possible mechanisms for uniparental disomy. One possibility is gamete complementation, i.e., the gamete from one parent containing both chromosomes of the pair and that from the other parent containing neither. When gamete complementation is the mechanism, the centromeres of the resulting pair will be heterodisomic if resulting from a meiosis 1 error, and isodisomic if resulting from a meiosis 2 error. Beyond that, meiosis 1 UPD, depending on crossing-over and segregation, may be wholly heterodisomic (holo-heterodisomy) or partially isodisomic (mero-isodisomy); meiosis 2 UPD should always result in an element of isodisomy embodied in the 2 segments of the nonseparated chromatids left unaffected by crossing-over. This unaffected segment thus tends to be juxtacentromeric. Gametic complementation UPD was reported by Wang et al. (1991), who found paternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14 in a 45,XX,t(13q14q)der pat proposita, whose 2 parents were balanced heterozygotes for a translocation involving chromosome 14. This situation is analogous to the effects of biparental translocation as in the mouse experiments of Cattanach and Kirk (1985). A second mechanism of UPD is so-called trisomy rescue or correction. It is expected that the remaining pair, after loss of the extra homolog, will be biparental in two-thirds of cases and uniparental in one-third of cases. In such instances, as in gamete complementation, isodisomy may or may not be present. Cases of UPD in Prader-Willi syndrome whose chromosomal 15 maternal disomy could be traced to a placental mosaicism for trisomy 15 documented at the time of choriocentesis (chorion villus sampling) performed for advanced maternal age were reported by Cassidy et al. (1992) and Purvis-Smith et al. (1992). A third situation is akin to the second; the abnormal initial zygotic situation is monosomy rather than trisomy and the abnormality is 'corrected' through duplication of the single available homolog. The case of cystic fibrosis with maternal chromosome 7 isodisomy and growth delay reported by Spence et al. (1988) may have been of this type, although there is at least one other explanation. Donnai (1993) pointed out that Robertsonian translocations, occurring with a frequency of about 1 in 10,000 live births, may be an important cause of UPD; such has been demonstrated to be the case for 13/15, 13/14, 14/14, and 22/22 translocations. Dysmorphologic features and/or mental retardation are clinical clues for uniparental disomy in apparently balanced offspring of translocation carriers. Among abortion products of balanced Robertsonian translocation carriers, an excess of 'normal balanced' conceptions has been noted. Robertsonian translocations involving chromosomes 13 and/or 21 are frequently ascertained through a trisomic child. Among those ascertained through a mentally retarded but nontrisomic proband, there appears to be overrepresentation of translocations involving chromosome 14. Since nonmosaic trisomy 14 is nonviable, such a conception would survive a pregnancy only by reducing to disomy. \n\nFridman et al. (1998) reported a patient with AS and the chromosome constitution 45,XY,t(15q15q). She had some unusual clinical features, including hyperphagia and obesity. Methylation analysis with a probe for small nuclear ribonucleoprotein N (SNRPN; 182279) at 15q12, microsatellite analyses of D15S11, GABRB3 (137192) and D15S113 loci, and FISH using SNRPN and GABRB3 probes indicated paternal isodisomy. This was the fourth reported case of translocation 15q15q with paternal uniparental disomy. Fridman et al. (1998) discussed possible explanations such as homozygosity due to paternal isodisomy for sequence variation (mutation) in one of the genes involved in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome. They pointed out that hyperphagia and obesity may occur specifically in association with AS in the context of certain genetic backgrounds, as mice with paternal UPD for the Ube3a region have a postnatal onset of severe obesity (Cattanach et al., 1997). \n\nIn studies reported by Robinson et al. (1993), most cases of paternal UPD leading to Angelman syndrome were meiosis II errors or, more likely, mitotic errors. In contrast, in more than 82% of cases of maternal UPD leading to Prader-Willi syndrome, the extra chromosome was due to a meiosis I nondisjunction event. A similar observation has been made for trisomy 21: the majority (78%) of maternal errors leading to trisomy 21 are attributable to meiosis I events, whereas most paternal errors are attributed to either meiosis II or mitotic events (40% and 33%, respectively) (Antonarakis et al., 1993). ",
				"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations": "On the basis of molecular and cytogenetic findings, Saitoh et al. (1994) classified 61 Angelman syndrome patients into 4 groups: familial cases without deletion, familial cases with submicroscopic deletion, sporadic cases with deletion, and sporadic cases without deletion. Among 53 sporadic cases, 37 (70%) had maternal deletion, which commonly extended from D15S9 to D15S12, although not all deletions were identical. Of 8 familial cases, 3 sibs from 1 family had a maternal deletion involving only 2 loci, D15S10 and GABRB3, which defined the critical region for AS phenotypes. Among sporadic and familial cases without deletion, no uniparental disomy was found. Of 23 patients with a normal karyotype, 10 (43%) showed a molecular deletion. Except for hypopigmentation of skin or hair, neurologic signs and facial characteristics were not distinctive in a particular group. Familial cases with submicroscopic deletion were not associated with hypopigmentation, suggesting that a gene for hypopigmentation is located outside the critical region of AS and is not imprinted. \n\nMinassian et al. (1998) found severe intractable epilepsy in patients with maternally inherited chromosome 15q11-q13 deletions but relatively mild epilepsy in patients with uniparental disomy methylation imprinting abnormalities or mutations in the UBE3A gene. \n\nMoncla et al. (1999) compared 20 nondeletion AS patients with 20 age-matched 15q11-q12 deletion AS patients. A less severe phenotype with regard to both physical anomalies and neurologic manifestations was found to be associated with nondeletion AS. The nondeletion cases included patients with paternal uniparental disomy, imprinting mutations, and UBE3A mutations. The clinical severity scale from more to less severe was deletion cases to UBE3A mutation cases to imprinting mutations and/or UPD cases. The molecular cases, however, have a potential high risk for recurrence. \n\nGillessen-Kaesbach et al. (1999) described 7 patients who lacked most of the features of Angelman syndrome: severe mental retardation, postnatal microcephaly, macrostomia and prognathia, absence of speech, ataxia, and a happy disposition. They presented, however, with obesity, muscular hypotonia, and mild mental retardation. Based on the latter findings, the patients were initially suspected of having Prader-Willi syndrome. DNA methylation analysis of SNRPN and D15S63, however, revealed the pattern of Angelman syndrome, i.e., the maternal band was faint or absent. Cytogenetic studies and microsatellite analysis demonstrated apparently normal chromosomes 15 of biparental origin. Gillessen-Kaesbach et al. (1999) concluded these patients had an imprinting defect and a previously unrecognized form of AS. They suggested that the mild phenotype may have been due to an incomplete imprinting defect or by cellular mosaicism. \n\nIn 25 patients with Angelman syndrome, Fridman et al. (2000) detected 21 with deletion and 4 with paternal UPD, 2 isodisomies originating by postzygotic error, and 1 meiotic stage II nondisjunction event. By comparison of the clinical data from these and published UPD patients with data from patients with deletions, they observed the following: the age at diagnosis was higher in the UPD group, microcephaly was more frequent among deletion patients, UPD children started walking earlier, epilepsy started later in UPD patients, weight above the 75th centile was reported mainly in UPD patients, and complete absence of speech was more common in the deletion patients. UPD patients had somewhat better verbal development and occipital frontal circumference in the upper normal range. \n\nLossie et al. (2001) studied 104 patients with a classic AS phenotype from 93 families. Twenty of the 104 patients (22%) had normal DNA methylation at 15q11-q13 and of these, 7 of 16 (44%) sporadic patients had mutations within the UBE3A gene. Lossie et al. (2001) identified 4 phenotypic patient groups based on molecular analysis: those with deletions, UPD and imprinting defects, UBE3A mutations, and those with unknown etiology. Patients with deletions were the most severely affected, while those with UPD and imprinting defects were the least severely affected. Patients with UPD and imprinting defects and UBE3A mutations were taller and heavier than those with deletions or of unknown etiology. Those with UPD and imprinting defects were the least likely to have microcephaly. Seizures began earlier in patients with deletions or AS of unknown etiology, and those with deletions were more likely to require anticonvulsive medication. \n\nMolfetta et al. (2004) reported 2 first cousins with AS who had inherited the same UBE3A frameshift mutation (601623.0010) from their asymptomatic mothers but presented discordant phenotypes. The proband had typical AS features, whereas her cousin had a more severe phenotype with asymmetric spasticity that originally led to the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Brain MRI showed mild cerebral atrophy in the proband and severe malformation in her cousin. Because the mutation was transmitted from the cousins' grandfather to only 2 of 8 sibs, Molfetta et al. (2004) raised the possibility of mosaicism. \n\nVarela et al. (2004) analyzed the phenotypic and behavioral variability in 49 AS patients with different classes of deletions and 9 patients with UPD. All BP1-BP3 (class I) patients had complete absence of vocalization, compared to only 62% of BP2-BP3 (class II) patients (p = 0.03); and the age of sitting without support was lower in BP2-BP3 patients (p = 0.04). Patients with deletions had a higher incidence of swallowing disorders and hypotonia compared to UPD patients (p = 0.015 and 0.031, respectively). UPD patients also showed significantly better physical growth, fewer or no seizures, a lower incidence of microcephaly, less ataxia, and higher cognitive skills. Varela et al. (2004) suggested that because of their milder or less typical phenotype, AS patients with UPD may remain undiagnosed, leading to overall underdiagnosis of the disease. \n\nTan et al. (2011) reported the clinical features of 92 patients with molecularly confirmed Angelman syndrome between the ages of 5 and 60 months. Class I (BP1-BP3) deletions were present in 32%, class II (BP2-BP3) deletions in 38%, other deletions in 4%, UPD/imprinting defects in 14%, and UBE3A mutations in 12%. Those with deletions were diagnosed significantly earlier (median age of 14 months) than those without deletions (median age of 24 months). Those with deletions, particularly class I deletions, weighed significantly less than the general population, and those with UPD/imprinting defects were significantly heavier than the general population. Twenty (22%) of all patients were underweight, all of whom had deletions or UBE3A mutations. Eight patients were obese, including 6 with UPD/imprinting defects and 2 with UBE3A mutations. Relative microcephaly was found in 80% of all patients and was most common in those with deletions. The most common behavioral findings were mouthing behavior (95%), short attention span (92%), ataxic or broad-based gait (88%), history of sleep difficulties (80%), and fascination with water (75%). Frequent, easily provoked laughter was observed in 60%. Clinical seizures were reported in only 65%, but all had an abnormal EEG. Seizures occurred in 83% of patients with a class I deletion. Those with deletions also had lower cognitive scales compared to patients without deletions. Tan et al. (2011) concluded that the most characteristic feature of AS is the neurobehavioral phenotype, but specific EEG findings are highly sensitive. The absence of seizures or of inappropriate laughter should not discourage consideration of this diagnosis."

		"Entry": "OMIM Entry: #123450",
		"AKA": "AKA: Cat Cry Syndrome",
		"Contents": [
			{
				"Description": "Cri-du-chat syndrome was first described by Lejeune et al. (1963) as a hereditary congenital syndrome associated with deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 5. The deletions can vary in size from extremely small and involving only band 5p15.2 to the entire short arm. Although the majority of deletions arise as new mutations, approximately 12% result from unbalanced segregation of translocations or recombination involving a pericentric inversion in one of the parents.",
				"History": "",
				"Clinical Features": "Cri-du-chat syndrome is characterized in young children by microcephaly, round face, hypertelorism, micrognathia, epicanthal folds, low-set ears, hypotonia, and severe psychomotor and mental retardation. One of the most characteristic features in newborns is a high-pitched cat-like cry that is usually considered diagnostic for the syndrome (see Overhauser et al., 1994); however, the characteristic cat-like cry without the typical dysmorphic and severe developmental features of the syndrome has been found in individuals with a deletion confined to 5p15.3 (see Overhauser et al., 1994 and Gersh et al., 1995). \n\nKjaer and Niebuhr (1999) studied profile radiographs of the cranial face in 23 patients with cri-du-chat syndrome collected in Denmark in the 1970s. Twenty-two patients had terminal deletions of chromosome 5, and 1 patient had an interstitial deletion. The cranial base angle was in most cases reduced and in no cases increased compared to age-related standards for normal individuals. Malformations in the bony contours of the sella turcica and the clivus occurred in cri-du-chat patients with terminal deletions. They pointed out that this specific cranial base region develops around the notochord at the location from where the rhombencephalic-derived brainstem, pons, and cerebellum develop dorsally, and from where the neurons to the larynx migrate ventrally. They suggested that a cranial developmental field, originating from the notochordal location, is involved in the manifestations of cri-du-chat syndrome. \n\nVan Buggenhout et al. (2000) pointed out that with advancing age the clinical picture of the cri-du-chat syndrome becomes less striking. They presented 7 patients with 5p deletion syndrome, with ages ranging from 16 to 47 years. Some of the clinical characteristics, such as long face, macrostomia, and scoliosis, became more evident. All patients were severely or profoundly mentally retarded except for one who was mildly retarded. Diagnosis was difficult to make in some of the patients who were first seen at an older age. In some of them, the craniofacial appearance resembled that of Angelman syndrome (105830). Most patients had periods of destructive behavior, self mutilation, and aggression. \n\nFang et al. (2008) reported a 3-generation Chinese Han family in which 5 members had cri-du-chat syndrome. The proband was a 62-year-old woman who presented to a psychiatric ward with temper tantrums, self-injuries, aggressive behavior, and psychotic symptoms, including delusions of persecution, auditory hallucinations, self-talking, and self-laughing. She had a soft, high-pitched, cat-like voice. Her 41-year-old daughter had mental retardation and similar psychotic features, which are rare in cri-du-chat syndrome. She did not have a high-pitched voice. In contrast, the other 3 affected males had mild to moderate mental retardation without psychotic symptoms. All affected individuals were found to have a 10.5-Mb terminal deletion at chromosome 5p15.2, which was confirmed and characterized by karyotyping, FISH, array CGH, and quantitative PCR analyses. The ROPN1L gene (611756) was found to be disrupted by the breakpoint. Although the affected family members apparently shared deletions of the same size, the variation in mental symptoms within this family suggested that other factors besides the size and location of 5p deletions may modify the mental presentation of patients with cri-du-chat syndrome. Fang et al. (2008) noted that familial occurrence of this disorder is rare. \n\nCornish et al. (1999) described a 2-generation family in which 4 members had a 5p deletion. The 39-year-old father had no history of developmental delay or facial dysmorphism, but reportedly had an unusual cry in infancy. His 3 children were diagnosed at birth with cri-du-chat syndrome because of an unusual cry and low birth weight. Sibs 1 and 3, aged 13 and 6 years, attended mainstream school, whereas sib 2, aged 10 years, attended a school for mild-moderate learning disabilities. Karyotype revealed a terminal deletion (5p15.3-pter) in all 4 family members. FISH analysis revealed that the deletion breakpoint was localized to 5p15.3. Neuropsychologic testing in the family revealed full scale IQ in the average range with the exception of sib 2 who had a low-average IQ. Examination of the sibs revealed reduced expressive language and articulation skills. The authors noted that expressive-receptive language discrepancy had also been reported in children with typical cri-du-chat syndrome but to a much greater severity. \n\nNguyen et al. (2015) reviewed natural history data based on parent reports involved in the 5p Minus Society, an online family support group. Data was collected on 286 individuals, of whom 59% were female. Health issues for individuals with 5p- included hearing loss (8.4% patients) and ophthalmologic problems (46%). Early intervention demonstrated earlier achievement of developmental milestones than children who had not received intervention. \n\nClinical Variability\n\nLadekarl (1968) reported a patient with features of cri-du-chat syndrome and Goldenhar syndrome (164210) associated with a 5q deletion. Choong et al. (2003) reported a male infant, born of nonconsanguineous parents, who had clinical features of cri-du-chat syndrome and Goldenhar syndrome. At birth, he was noted to have dysmorphic facial features, including bilateral preauricular tags, rotated ears, epicanthal folds, a left epibulbar lipodermoid, and an accessory left nipple. He also had hearing loss and feeding difficulties due to esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula, and horseshoe kidney. In addition, he had a high-pitched, cat-like cry, characteristic of cri-du-chat syndrome. Cytogenetic analysis detected a terminal deletion of chromosome 5p14, consistent with the cri-du-chat locus. The association of Goldenhar syndrome and cri-du-chat syndrome in this patient suggested that the chromosome 5p14 locus may harbor a gene implicated with Goldenhar syndrome. ",

		"Contents": [
			{
				"Description": "",
				"History": "Hagenfeldt et al. (1987) and Kvittingen et al. (1986) reported cases of N-acetylaspartic aciduria in patients with leukodystrophy and progressive cerebral atrophy, respectively. In the case of Kvittingen et al. (1986), aspartoacylase activity was normal, whereas in the case of Hagenfeldt et al. (1987), aspartoacylase activity was deficient. However, neither of these reports linked the findings to Canavan disease. Divry et al. (1988) reported a brother and sister with N-acetylaspartic aciduria and a neurologic syndrome associated with macrocephaly and leukodystrophy. Enzyme data were not available. ",
				"Clinical Features": "The salient clinical features of Canavan disease are onset in early infancy, atonia of neck muscles, hypotonia, hyperextension of legs and flexion of arms, blindness, severe mental defect, megalocephaly, and death by 18 months on the average. The neurologic findings are due to demyelination and leukodystrophy. Neuropathologic changes include spongy degeneration and astrocytic swelling with normal neurons (Matalon et al., 1988 and Matalon et al., 1989). Morphologic abnormality of the mitochondria of astrocytes was emphasized by Adornato et al. (1972). \n\nIn 3 patients from 2 families of Ashkenazi descent with the diagnosis of cerebral spongy degeneration, or Canavan disease, Matalon et al. (1988) found increased amounts of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the urine and plasma. Aspartoacylase was assayed in cultured skin fibroblasts from 1 patient of each family, and a profound deficiency of the enzyme was found. Although the function of N-acetylaspartic acid was not understood, it was known to occur in high concentration in human brain. In an addendum, Matalon et al. (1988) reported finding aspartoacylase deficiency in a case of Canavan disease in a third family from Australia. \n\nMatalon et al. (1989) reported studies of 21 patients with Canavan disease. The diagnosis of spongy degeneration was confirmed by brain biopsy in 14. All patients had excessive urinary NAA excretion almost 200 times the amounts found in normal age-matched individuals or obligate carriers. One sample of cerebrospinal fluid from a patient with Canavan disease contained 232 micromoles/liter of NAA, whereas in a control sample NAA was undetectable. Deficiency of aspartoacylase was found in all 21 patients. The levels of aspartoacylase in obligate carriers were less than 50% of control values. Matalon et al. (1989) also showed that NAA was not elevated in the urine in other forms of leukodystrophy such as Alexander disease (203450), in which megalencephaly similar to that in patients with Canavan disease occurs, metachromatic leukodystrophy (250100), Krabbe disease (245200), and adrenoleukodystrophy (300100). \n\nMatalon et al. (1989) indicated that congenital, infantile, and late-onset forms of Canavan disease had been reported. Pathologic studies show spongy degeneration of the brain white matter, which is a nonspecific morphologic change and occurs in a number of situations. For example, spongy degeneration rather closely resembling that of Canavan disease was observed in a case of homocystinuria (236200) (Chou and Waisman, 1965). \n\nFeigelman et al. (1991) described prolonged survival in a 33-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish woman with Canavan disease. At the age of 2 years, mental retardation and extrapyramidal cerebral palsy had been diagnosed. At age 5 years, she was blind, but both pupils reacted to light, and she showed decerebrate posturing elicited by acute extension of the neck. Hyperreflexia with an extensor plantar response was observed. Generalized seizures first occurred at age 8 years. By age 20, she showed bilateral optic atrophy. By the time of report at age 33.5 years, she had deteriorated to a 'persistent vegetative state.' A younger sister was also mentally retarded with delayed development and died following aspiration at the age of 9 years.\n\nIn 2 sibs with Canavan disease from a consanguineous marriage, Ishiyama et al. (2003) examined the temporal bone and found bilateral absence of the organ of Corti as well as absence of supporting cells and hair cells. There was mild secondary atrophy of the spiral ganglia neurons, but the auditory nerves and vestibular end organs and nerves were normal. The authors suggested a role for ASPA in the neurodevelopment of the organ of Corti",
				"Diagnosis": "Kaul et al. (1993) stated that they had diagnosed 145 patients with Canavan disease at their center alone, suggesting that the disorder is more prevalent than previously thought. They noted that prenatal diagnosis by enzymatic activity is difficult because of the low or undetectable aspartoacylase activity in direct or cultured normal chorionic villi and in normal cultured amniocytes.",
				"Cytogenetics": "",
				"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations": "Janson et al. (2006) reported 2 sisters with a mild form of Canavan disease confirmed by the finding of compound heterozygous mutations in the ASPA gene (A305E, 608034.0003; and R71H, 608034.0012). They presented at ages 50 and 19 months, respectively, with developmental delay, but without macrocephaly, hypotonia, spasticity, or seizures. The older child had mild cognitive and social impairment, whereas the infant showed age-appropriate language and behavior. In vitro studies showed severely deficient ASPA enzyme activity, but cerebral NAA levels in both patients were significantly less than expected for classic Canavan disease. Janson et al. (2006) noted that other patients had been reported with a milder, protracted Velinov et al. (2008) reported a 28-month-old girl with a mild form of Canavan disease associated with homozygosity for the R71H mutation. The parents were not related and originated from Ecuador. The child showed mild motor and speech delay at age 9 months and developed symmetric hyperintensities in the basal ganglia at age 18 months. She walked at age 19 months and spoke about 20 words at 25 months. She did not have macrocephaly or seizures. NAA levels were about 15 times greater than normal, but lower than observed in classic cases of Canavan disease. Velinov et al. (2008) concluded that the R71H mutation is associated with a milder form of the disorder. course of Canavan disease (Toft et al., 1993; Zafeiriou et al., 1999), which did not seem to correlate with enzyme activity. "

		"Title": "DiGeorge Syndrome",
		"Entry": "OMIM Entry: #188400",
		"AKA": "AKA: Chromosome 22q11.2 Deletion",
		"Contents": [
			{
				"Description": "DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) comprises hypocalcemia arising from parathyroid hypoplasia, thymic hypoplasia, and outflow tract defects of the heart. Disturbance of cervical neural crest migration into the derivatives of the pharyngeal arches and pouches can account for the phenotype. Most cases result from a deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 (the DiGeorge syndrome chromosome region, or DGCR). Several genes are lost including the putative transcription factor TUPLE1 which is expressed in the appropriate distribution. This deletion may present with a variety of phenotypes: Shprintzen, or velocardiofacial, syndrome (VCFS; 192430); conotruncal anomaly face (or Takao syndrome); and isolated outflow tract defects of the heart including tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, and interrupted aortic arch. A collective acronym CATCH22 has been proposed for these differing presentations. A small number of cases of DGS have defects in other chromosomes, notably 10p13 (see 601362). In the mouse, a transgenic Hox A3 (Hox 1.5) knockout produces a phenotype similar to DGS as do the teratogens retinoic acid and alcohol.",
				"History": "The original description of the syndrome was derived from a published discussion at an immunology meeting (Cooper et al., 1965). DiGeorge (1968) published a formal report 3 years later. The report by Strong (1968) predated this formal report and probably represents the same variable disorder. Kimura (1977) reported velopharyngeal deficiency in a series of patients without cleft palate. The Japanese language report by Kinouchi et al. (1976) and the English reports, by Takao et al. (1980)and Shimizu et al. (1984), delineated the syndrome in the Japanese population. The acronym CATCH22 derives from the phrase Catch 22, which was used by Joseph Heller as the title of his book (Heller, 1962).",
				"Clinical Features": "DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by neonatal hypocalcemia, which may present as tetany or seizures, due to hypoplasia of the parathyroid glands, and susceptibility to infection due to a deficit of T cells. The immune deficit is caused by hypoplasia or aplasia of the thymus gland. A variety of cardiac malformations are seen in particular affecting the outflow tract. These include tetralogy of Fallot, type B interrupted aortic arch, truncus arteriosus, right aortic arch and aberrant right subclavian artery. In infancy, micrognathia may be present. The ears are typically low set and deficient in the vertical diameter with abnormal folding of the pinna. Telecanthus with short palpebral fissures is seen. Both upward and downward slanting eyes have been described. The philtrum is short and the mouth relatively small. In the older child the features overlap Shprintzen syndrome (velocardiofacial syndrome) with a rather bulbous nose and square nasal tip and hypernasal speech associated with submucous or overt palatal clefting. Cases presenting later tend to have a milder spectrum of cardiac defect with ventricular septal defect being common.\n\nShort stature and variable mild to moderate learning difficulties are common. A variety of psychiatric disorders have been described in a small proportion of adult cases of velocardiofacial syndrome. These have included paranoid schizophrenia and major depressive illness. Clinical features seen more rarely include hypothyroidism, cleft lip, and deafness.\n\nGoodship et al. (1995) described monozygotic twin brothers with precisely the same 22q11.2 deletion but somewhat discordant clinical phenotype. Both twins had a small mouth, square nasal tip, short palpebral fissures, and small ears with deficient upper helices. Twin 1 had bilateral hair whorls and twin 2 had a right-sided hair whorl. Toes 4 and 5 were curled under bilaterally in both boys, this being more marked in twin 1. The twins were said to have had a single placenta although the findings of a detailed examination were not recorded. Twin 1 weighed 2,200 g and twin 2 weighed 2,800 g. Twin 1 had tetralogy of Fallot, which was repaired at 1 year of age. Twin 2 had a normal cardiovascular system. Twin 1 started taking steps at 24 months of age, while his brother stood at 13 months and walked steadily at 18 months. These observations indicated to Goodship et al. (1995) that differences in deletion size and modifying genetic loci are not responsible for all the phenotypic differences observed in CATCH22. \n\nVincent et al. (1999) reported the case of female monozygotic twins with 22q11 deletions. The twins shared facial characteristics of DGS/VCFS and immunologic defect. However, only one, who died on day 5, had a cardiac defect, composed of an interrupted aortic arch with a ventricular septal defect, a truncus arteriosus, and a large arterial duct. The authors stated that this was the fourth report of a discrepant cardiac status between monozygotic twins harboring 22q11 deletions. \n\nWilson et al. (1992) looked for deletions in 9 families with 2 or more cases of outflow tract heart defects. In 5 of the families, chromosome 22 deletions were detected in all living affected persons studied and also in the clinically normal father of 3 affected children. The deletion was transmitted from parents to offspring and was associated with an increase in the severity of cardiac defects. No deletions were found in 4 families in which the parents were normal and affected sibs had anatomically identical defects, presumably an autosomal recessive form of congenital heart defect. \n\nFokstuen et al. (1998) analyzed 110 patients with nonselective syndromic or isolated nonfamilial congenital heart malformations by fluorescence in situ hybridization using the D22S75 DGS region probe. A 22q11.2 microdeletion was detected in 9 of 51 (17.6%) syndromic patients. Five were of maternal origin and 4 of paternal origin. None of the 59 patients with isolated congenital cardiac defect had the 22q11.2 deletion. In a study of 157 consecutively catheterized patients with isolated, nonsyndromic cardiac defects, and 25 patients with cardiac malformation and additional abnormalities (10 of whom had been clinically diagnosed as DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome), Borgmann et al. (1999) found the 22q11.2 microdeletion only in the latter group. \n\nJawad et al. (2001) studied 195 patients with chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome and found that diminished T-cell counts in the peripheral blood are common. The pattern of changes seen with aging in normal control patients was also seen in patients with the chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, although the decline in T cells was blunted. Autoimmune disease was seen in most age groups, although the types of disorders varied according to age. Infections were also common in older patients, although they were seldom life-threatening. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with onset between 1.5 and 6 years of age was seen in 4 of the 195 patients; idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura with onset at 1 to 8 years of age was seen in 8 of 195 patients; autoimmune hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, vitiligo, inflammatory bowel disease, adult rheumatoid arthritis, and rheumatic fever with chorea were each seen in 1 patient of the 195 patients sampled. \n\nKawame et al. (2001) reported 5 patients with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion that manifested Graves disease between the ages of 27 months and 16 years, and suggested that Graves disease may be part of the clinical spectrum of this disorder. \n\nBassett et al. (2005) described the phenotypic features of 78 adults with 22q11 deletion syndrome and identified 43 distinct features present in more than 5% of patients. Common characteristic features included intellectual disabilities (92.3%), hypocalcemia (64%), palatal anomalies (42%), and cardiovascular anomalies (25.8%). Other less commonly appreciated features included obesity (35%), hypothyroidism (20.5%), hearing deficits (28%), cholelithiasis (19%), scoliosis (47%), and dermatologic abnormalities (severe acne, 23%; seborrhea, 35%). Significantly, schizophrenia was present in 22.6% of patients. \n\nMaalouf et al. (2004) reported an African American male diagnosed at age 32 years with dysgenesis of the parathyroid glands due to a chromosome 22 microdeletion. Symptomatic hypocalcemia did not develop until age 14 years, a few weeks after initiation of anticonvulsant therapy for generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Because of the timing for onset of symptomatic hypocalcemia, it was presumed that the patient had anticonvulsant-induced hypocalcemia, and he carried that diagnosis for 18 years. Chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome was first suspected at age 32 years. The diagnosis was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. This case underscores the variable clinical presentation of this congenital form of hypoparathyroidism. \n\nKousseff (1984) described 3 sibs with a syndrome of sacral meningocele, conotruncal cardiac defects, unilateral renal agenesis (in 1 sib), low-set and posteriorly angulated ears, retrognathia, and short neck with low posterior hairline. Kousseff (1984) suggested autosomal recessive inheritance. Toriello et al. (1985) reported a similar, isolated case and designated the disorder Kousseff syndrome. Forrester et al. (2002) restudied the family reported by Kousseff (1984) and identified a 22q11-q13 deletion in the proband, his deceased brother, and his father. The proband had spina bifida, shunted hydrocephalus, cleft palate, short stature, cognitive impairment, and the typical craniofacial features of velocardiofacial syndrome, including low-set and dysplastic ears, broad base of the nose, narrow alae nasi, and retrognathia. His brother had died at 2 weeks of age with myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus, transposition of the great vessels, and unilateral renal agenesis, and his sister had died at 22 days of age with myelomeningocele, truncus arteriosus, hypocalcemia, and autopsy findings of absent thymus and parathyroid glands, consistent with DiGeorge anomaly. \n\nMaclean et al. (2004) reported 2 unrelated patients with Kousseff syndrome, 1 with a 22q11.2 deletion and the other without. The first was a 4-year-old girl with a sacral myelomeningocele, tetralogy of Fallot, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and moderate developmental delay, who had a normal chromosome 22q11.2 FISH test and did not exhibit the facial phenotype of VCFS. The second patient, a male infant who died at 10 days of age, had a large sacral myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus, Arnold-Chiari malformation, atrial septal defect, conoventricular ventricular septal defect, type B interrupted aortic arch, hypocalcemia, and suspected duodenal stenosis; FISH testing revealed a 22q11.2 microdeletion. Maclean et al. (2004) concluded that Kousseff syndrome is a distinct clinical entity that is genetically heterogeneous. \n\nKujat et al. (2006) reported that 5 (83%) of 6 patients with a 22q11.2 microdeletion had renal anomalies, including renal dysplasia, hydronephrosis, and unilateral renal agenesis. \n\nRobin et al. (2006) reviewed clinical data including brain imaging on 21 patients with polymicrogyria associated with deletion 22q11.2 and another 11 patients from the literature. The authors found that the cortical malformation consisted of perisylvian polymicrogyria of variable severity and frequent asymmetry with a striking predisposition for the right hemisphere (p = 0.008). \n\nForbes et al. (2007) reported the ocular features of 90 consecutive patients with confirmed 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Posterior embryotoxon was found in 49%, tortuous retinal vessels in 34%, eyelid hooding in 20%, strabismus in 18%, ptosis in 4%, amblyopia in 4%, and tilted optic nerves in 1%.\n\nSundaram et al. (2007) described 2 patients with 22q11.2 deletion who had absent uterus and unilateral renal agenesis. One patient also had mild developmental delay, hypoparathyroidism, and psychiatric symptoms; the other patient also had high-arched palate, bulbous nasal tip, bicuspid aortic valve, short stature, and primary amenorrhea. Sundaram et al. (2007) suggested that mullerian or uterine/vaginal agenesis be included as part of the clinical spectrum of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Scheuerle (2008) reported a 14-year-old Latin American girl with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome who was found to have unilateral renal agenesis, uterine didelphys with duplication of the cervix, and imperforate vaginal hymen with hematometrocolpos. \n\nBinenbaum et al. (2008) reported 4 boys and 3 girls with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, including 5 who had bilateral sclerocornea. Other eye findings included descemetocele in 5 eyes, microphthalmia in 1 eye, severe anterior segment dysgenesis in 1 eye, and bilateral iridocorneal adhesions in 1 patient. Binenbaum et al. (2008) suggested that a genetic locus at chromosome 22q11.2 may be involved in anterior segment embryogenesis, and that sclerocornea should be added to the clinical manifestations of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. \n\nCheung et al. (2014) used a logistic regression model to investigate potential predictors of intellectual disability severity, including neonatal hypocalcemia, neonatal seizures, and complex congenital heart disease in 149 adults with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, 10 of whom had moderate to severe intellectual disability. The model was highly significant (p less than 0.0001), showing neonatal seizures (p = 0.0018) and neonatal hypocalcemia (p = 0.047) to be significant predictors of a more severe level of intellectual disability. Neonatal seizures were significantly associated with hypocalcemia in the entire sample, regardless of intellectual level",
				"Diagnosis": "De la Chapelle et al. (1981) suggested that DiGeorge syndrome may be due to a deletion within chromosome 22 or partial duplication of 20p, based on finding the syndrome in members of a family with a 20;22 translocation. Specifically, they observed DGS in 4 members of 1 family and demonstrated monosomy of 22pter-q11 and 20p duplication. Their interpretation that DGS might result from monosomy for 22q11 was confirmed by Kelley et al. (1982) in 3 patients with translocation of 22q11-qter to other chromosomes. \n\nGreenberg et al. (1984) observed partial monosomy due to an unbalanced 4;22 translocation in a 2-month-old male with type 1 truncus arteriosus and features of DGS. The asymptomatic mother showed partial T-cell deficiency and the same unbalanced translocation with deletion of proximal 22q11. \n\nAugusseau et al. (1986) observed telecanthus, microretrognathia, severe aortic coarctation with hypoplastic left aortic arch, decreased E rosettes, and mild neonatal hypocalcemia. The same translocation was present in the clinically normal mother and maternal aunt. The latter had had her fourth pregnancy aborted because of cardiac and other malformations detected on ultrasound. This translocation has proved important in analysis of the expressed sequences in the deleted segment. \n\nThe recognition of the importance of 22q11 deletion grew with improving techniques. Greenberg et al. (1988) found chromosome abnormalities in 5 of 27 cases of DGS, 3 with 22q11 deletion though only one of these was an interstitial deletion. \n\nWilson et al. (1992) reported high resolution banding (more than 850 bands per haploid set) in 30 of 36 cases of DGS and demonstrated 9 cases of interstitial deletion. All other cases were apparently normal. Use of molecular dosage analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes isolated from within the deleted area revealed deletion in 21 of the 22 cases with normal karyotypes (Carey et al., 1992) giving pooled results of 33 deleted among the consecutive series of 35 cases. Driscoll et al. (1992) also found deletions at the molecular level in all 14 cases studied. \n\nWhereas 90% of cases of DGS may now be attributed to a 22q11 deletion, other chromosome defects have been identified. In the report of Greenberg et al. (1988), there was 1 case of DGS with del10p13 and one with an 18q21.33 deletion. Fukushima et al. (1992) found a female infant with a deletion of 4q21.3-q25 associated with interrupted aortic arch, VSD, ASD, and PDA; T cell deficit and a small thymus at surgery; absent corpus callosum; and dysmorphic features. The possibility of an unrecognized submicroscopic deletion of 22q11 should be considered in such cases, although it is clear that the disturbance of neural crest migration presumed to underlie DGS may be caused by several distinct defects at the molecular level. \n\nPinto-Escalante et al. (1998) described a premature male infant with mosaic monosomy of chromosome 22. His facial appearance was similar to that in DiGeorge syndrome; hypertonicity, limitation of extension of major joints, and flexion contracture of all fingers were also present. They found previous reports of monosomy 22 in 6 cases, 3 of which were nonmosaic and 3 mosaic. There was great variability in anomalies in these patients; however, the most common anomalies were in the face and joints. \n\nGottlieb et al. (1998) determined the location and extent of the deletion on chromosome 10 in 5 DiGeorge syndrome patients by means of a combination of heterozygosity tests and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. The results did not support the existence of a single, commonly deleted region on 10p in these 5 patients. Rather, they suggested that deletion of more than 1 region on 10p could be associated with the DGS phenotype. Furthermore, there was no obvious correlation between the phenotypic traits of the patients and the extent of the deletion. The patient with the largest deletion exhibited one of the less severe phenotypes. The authors commented that the lack of a correlation between the size of a deletion and the phenotype is observed also with deletions on chromosome 22 and may be a characteristic of haploinsufficiency disorders.",

				"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations": "Patients with DiGeorge syndrome are hemizygous for the COMT gene (116790). In a study of 21 nonpsychotic DiGeorge syndrome patients aged 7 to 16 years, Shashi et al. (2006) found that those carrying the met allele of the COMT V158M polymorphism (116790.0001), which results in increased dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, performed better on tests of general cognitive ability and on a specific test of prefrontal cognition compared to those with the val allele. Glaser et al. (2006) tested measures of executive function, IQ, and memory in 34 children and young adults with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (14 hemizygous for val158 and 30 for met158). No significant differences were detected between met- and val-hemizygous participants on measures of executive function. The groups did not differ on full-scale, performance, and verbal IQ or on verbal and visual memory. Glaser et al. (2006) suggested that either the COMT polymorphism has a small effect on executive function in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome or no effect exists at all. \n\nLopez-Rivera et al. (2017) conducted a genomewide search for structural variants in 2 cohorts: 2,080 patients with congenital kidney and urinary tract anomalies and 22,094 controls. Exome and targeted resequencing was performed in samples obtained from 586 additional patients with congenital kidney anomalies. Functional studies were also performed in zebrafish and mice. Lopez-Rivera et al. (2017) identified heterozygous deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 in 1% of patients with congenital kidney anomalies and in 0.01% of population controls (OR = 81.5, p = 4.5 x 10(-14)). The main driver of renal disease in DiGeorge syndrome was a 370-kb region containing 9 genes. In zebrafish embryos, an induced loss of function in snap29 (604202), aifm3 (617298), and crkl (602007) resulted in renal defects; the loss of crkl alone was sufficient to induce defects. Five of 586 patients with congenital urinary anomalies had newly identified heterozygous protein-altering variants, including a premature termination codon, in CRKL. The inactivation of Crkl in the mouse model induced developmental defects similar to those observed in patients with congenital urinary anomalies. Lopez-Rivera et al. (2017) concluded that a recurrent 370-kb deletion in the 22q11.2 locus is the driver of kidney defects in DiGeorge syndrome and in sporadic congenital kidney and urinary tract anomalies. Of the 9 genes at this locus, SNAP29, AIFM3, and CRKL appear to be critical to the phenotype, with haploinsufficiency of CRKL emerging as the main genetic driver"

				"Description": "Dystrophin-associated muscular dystrophies range from the severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) to the milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD; 300376). Mapping and molecular genetic studies indicate that both are the result of mutations in the huge gene that encodes dystrophin, also symbolized DMD. Approximately two-thirds of the mutations in both forms are deletions of one or many exons in the dystrophin gene. Although there is no clear correlation found between the extent of the deletion and the severity of the disorder, DMD deletions usually result in frameshift. Boland et al. (1996) studied a retrospective cohort of 33 male patients born between 1953 and 1983. The mean age at DMD diagnosis was 4.6 years; wheelchair dependency had a median age of 10 years; cardiac muscle failure developed in 15% of patients with a median age of 21.5 years; smooth muscle dysfunction in the digestive or urinary tract occurred in 21% and 6% of the patients, respectively, at a median age of 15 years. In this cohort, death occurred at a median age of 17 years. The authors commented that the diagnosis of DMD is being made at an earlier age but survival has not changed.",
				"History": "",
				"Clinical Features": "The most distinctive feature of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a progressive proximal muscular dystrophy with characteristic pseudohypertrophy of the calves. The bulbar (extraocular) muscles are spared but the myocardium is affected. There is massive elevation of creatine kinase levels in the blood, myopathic changes by electromyography, and myofiber degeneration with fibrosis and fatty infiltration on muscle biopsy.The onset of Duchenne muscular dystrophy usually occurs before age 3 years, and the victim is chairridden by age 12 and dead by age 20. The onset of Becker muscular dystrophy is often in the 20s and 30s and survival to a relatively advanced age is frequent.\n\nMoser and Emery (1974) found that some female heterozygotes had myopathy resembling autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (253600). Serum creatine kinase was particularly elevated in these patients. In most populations, the frequency of manifesting heterozygotes is about the same as that of females with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. \n\nSoloway and Mudge (1979) remarked that patients with advanced muscular dystrophy may develop hypokalemia from insults (vomiting, diarrhea, diuretics) that would have little effect on normal persons. Reduced intracellular potassium stores are responsible for this perilous situation, which may be the mechanism of death. \n\nIn an Italian boy with congenital myopathy, born to nonconsanguineous parents, Prelle et al. (1992) found absence of dystrophin in the patient's muscle by immunohistochemical methods and a deletion of the 5-prime end of the dystrophin gene. Although the patient showed severe mental retardation, there was no cerebral atrophy. Cardiomyopathy was also present. \n\nFrigeri et al. (1998) analyzed AQP4 expression in the skeletal muscle of mdx mice; immunofluorescence experiments showed a marked reduction of aquaporin-4 (AQP4; 600308) expression, suggesting a critical role in the membrane alteration of DMD. \n\nWakayama et al. (2002) analyzed skeletal muscle samples from 6 patients with DMD and found markedly reduced AQP4 expression by immunohistochemical staining and markedly decreased levels of AQP4 mRNA as measured by RT-PCR, compared to controls. Genomic analysis of the AQP4 gene revealed no abnormalities. The authors concluded that the reduced mRNA was due to either decreased transcription or increased degradation of the message. \n\nNoguchi et al. (2003) performed cDNA microarray analysis on skeletal muscle biopsy specimens from 6 patients with DMD. There was increased expression of genes related to immune response, sarcomere, extracellular matrix proteins, and signaling or cell growth. Upregulation of these genes reflected dystrophic changes, myofiber necrosis, inflammation, and muscle regeneration. Genes related to muscle homeostasis and energy metabolism were downregulated. ",
				"Diagnosis": "Clinical diagnosis of males affected with DMD is straightforward. Gait difficulty beginning at age three, progressive myopathic weakness with pseudohypertrophy of calves and massive elevations of serum levels of creatine kinase permit diagnosis. Electromyography and muscle biopsy are confirmatory. Inflammatory changes seen in biopsies taken early in the course of the disorder can erroneously suggest a diagnosis of polymyositis if careful note is not made of the histologic hallmarks of dystrophy.\n\nHeyck et al. (1966) documented a high level of CPK (and other enzymes) in a 9-day-old infant from a family at risk. According to Dubowitz (1976), elevation in cord blood in a proven case had not been documented. Furthermore, many perinatal factors seem to cause elevation of CPK. Mahoney et al. (1977) demonstrated elevated CPK in fetal blood obtained by placental puncture and validated this as a method of prenatal diagnosis by demonstrating histologic changes in the skeletal muscle of the aborted fetus. \n\nDarras et al. (1987) reported experience suggesting that despite the large number of intragenic and flanking DNA polymorphisms then available, uncertainties often remain in the prenatal diagnosis of DMD. \n\nBartlett et al. (1988) pointed out that mapping of deletions is a more reliable and an easier way to do prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection than by use of RFLPs. They suggested that once the entire gene is available for screening, most DMD boys will show deletions. Katayama et al. (1988) demonstrated the usefulness of RFLPs in prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection of DMD. In some of the examples cited, the authors made use of creatine phosphokinase levels as well. Speer et al. (1989) reviewed the status of prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection using cDNA probes. Clemens et al. (1991) took advantage of the existence of approximately 50,000-100,000 (CA)n loci in the human genome (Tautz and Renz, 1984) for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis in DMD and BMD. (CA)n loci are a subclass of all short tandem repeat (STR) sequences. Because they are frequently polymorphic, so-called pSTR, they are useful for linkage purposes and are readily studied by PCR. \n\nBieber et al. (1989) described the use of immunoblotting for dystrophin analysis in the diagnosis of DMD in cases in which a gene deletion cannot be identified and RFLPs are equivocal. Evans et al. (1991) used in utero fetal muscle biopsy to assess dystrophin in a male fetus with the same X chromosome as an affected sib. Evans et al. (1993) used the same procedure to evaluate a female fetus found on amniocentesis performed for advanced maternal age to be carrying a de novo X;1 translocation with a breakpoint at Xp21. In utero muscle biopsy at 20 weeks of gestation showed normal dystrophin, and serum creatine kinase was normal at the time of birth of the infant. Situations in which testing of dystrophin by fetal muscle biopsy may be indicated were reviewed. Sancho et al. (1993) demonstrated that when conventional DNA analysis is not informative for the prenatal and postnatal diagnosis of DMD, myogenesis can be induced in cultured skin fibroblasts, amniocytes, or chorionic-villus cells by infecting the cells with a retrovirus vector containing MYOD (159970), a gene regulating myogenesis. Immunocytochemical analysis of dystrophin in the MYOD-converted muscle cells is an effective way of demonstrating dystrophin deficiency. \n\nBeggs and Kunkel (1990) presented a flow diagram illustrating procedures for the molecular diagnosis of DMD or BMD. For males with consistent clinical features, CPK levels, and muscle biopsy, they suggested that Western blot testing for dystrophin be done first. If this is normal, the patient should be studied for other neuromuscular diseases. If dystrophin is of reduced or increased size, with or without reduction in the amount of dystrophin, BMD should be suspected. If dystrophin is absent, DMD should be suspected. Thereafter, PCR testing and Southern blot analysis should be done, looking for deletion/duplication. These procedures detect about 65% of patients, and the Southern blot permits prognostication of severity by distinguishing in-frame versus frameshift mutations in over 90% of cases. If no deletion or duplication is found, it is then necessary to resort to RFLP-based linkage studies, which unfortunately are laborious and time consuming. Once the diagnosis has been made, the information can be used for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis. In females who are having symptoms of muscular dystrophy, immunohistochemistry for dystrophin in muscle showing a patchy loss of dystrophin can be used, and when abnormality is found, the same procedures of PCR, Southern blot, and linkage studies can be pursued. If the immunohistochemistry is normal, the female can be studied for other neuromuscular diseases. (Abnormality is indicative of the manifesting carrier state.) Beggs and Kunkel (1990) provided useful illustrative case histories as well as a hypothetical case in which a newborn male was found to have elevated CPK on a screening program but normal physical examination and negative family history. If Western blotting revealed absence of detectable dystrophin in the muscle and the PCR analysis detected a deletion which was confirmed by Southern blotting, his mother might carry the deletion or be normal. Even if normal, prenatal diagnosis could be offered her because of the significant probability that she was a germline mosaic. The usefulness of such screening programs for diagnosing DMD at a stage when diagnosis can be useful to the parents in the planning of other pregnancies is worthy of consideration. \n\nKristjansson et al. (1994) used primer extension preamplification (PEP) to increase the scope and capacity of single cell genetic diagnosis by generating sufficient template to perform multiple subsequent DNA analyses using PCR. They reported the simultaneous analysis of single cells at 5 commonly deleted dystrophin exons. In 93% of PEP reactions with single amniocytes, chorionic villus cells and blastomeres, successful results were obtained, and a blinded analysis of single lymphoblasts from affected males resulted in 93% diagnostic accuracy. They suggested that transfer of unaffected male embryos and improved diagnostic reliability is achieved with the ability to perform replicate multilocus analyses from the same blastomere. \n\nParsons et al. (1996) discussed procedures used for disclosure of the diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy to parents after newborn screening. Newborn screening for DMD was introduced into Wales in 1990. While screening in the newborn period for DMD was still under evaluation, preliminary evidence indicated that the excessive trauma anticipated in making such a disclosure presymptomatically could be avoided by implementing a strict protocol of disclosure and support. Parental choice should be facilitated at every stage from screen to diagnosis, and parents should be provided with maximum unbiased information on which to base their decisions. The family should not experience delay in getting the results with the additional stress this may cause. Meetings with the primary health care team and with the pediatrician facilitated ongoing support for the family. ",
				"Cytogenetics": "Greenstein et al. (1977) found DMD in a 16-year-old girl with a reciprocal X;11 translocation. The mother was thought not to be a carrier. Possibly the break at Xp21 caused a null mutation; the normal X chromosome was inactivated. Verellen et al. (1978) reported the same situation with X;21 translocation and break at Xp21. Canki et al. (1979) described similar findings in a girl with X;3 translocation with break at Xp21. The mother was thought to be heterozygous.\n\nZneimer et al. (1993) used a combination of conventional and molecular cytogenetic techniques to investigate the twins first reported by Richards et al. (1990). The twins carried a deletion of approximately 300 kb within the dystrophin gene on one X chromosome. A unique DNA fragment generated from an exon within the deletion was hybridized in situ to metaphase chromosomes of both twins, a probe that would presumably hybridize only to the normal X chromosome and not to the X chromosome carrying the deletion. The chromosomes were identified by reverse-banding (R-banding) and by the addition of 5-bromodeoxyuridine in culture to distinguish early and late replicating X chromosomes, corresponding to active and inactive X chromosomes, respectively. The experiment showed predominant inactivation of the normal X chromosome in the twin with DMD. With an improved method of high resolution R-banding, Werner and Spiegler (1988) showed deletion of Xp21.13 in an 8-year-old boy with normal intelligence and no disorder other than DMD. His healthy mother was heterozygous for the deletion, which was subject to random X inactivation in lymphocytes. \n\nSaito-Ohara et al. (2002) studied a 16-year-old patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, profound mental retardation, athetosis, and nystagmus who was shown to have a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome, 46,Y,inv(X)(p21.2q22.2). His mother carried this inversion on one allele. The patient's condition was originally misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy. Because the DMD gene is located at Xp21.2, which is one breakpoint of the inv(X), and because its defects are rarely associated with severe mental retardation, the other clinical features of this patient were deemed likely to be associated with the opposite breakpoint at Xq22. The molecular-cytogenetic characterization of both breakpoints revealed 3 genetic events that probably had disastrous influence on neuromuscular and cognitive development: deletion of part of the DMD gene at Xp21.2, duplication of the proteolipid protein gene (PLP1; 300401) at Xq22.2, and disruption of the RAB40AL gene (300405). Saito-Ohara et al. (2002) speculated that disruption of RAB40AL was responsible for the patient's profound mental retardation. \n\nTran et al. (2013) reported a 3-year-old Japanese boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and moderate mental retardation associated with an intrachromosomal inversion, inv(X)(p21.2;q28), involving both the dystrophin and the KUCG1 (300892) genes. KUCG1 is a long noncoding RNA that shows brain expression. The first exon of KUCG1 was spliced to a dislocated part of the dystrophin gene, producing a chimeric dystrophin transcript. Brain MRI in the patient was normal. Tran et al. (2013) hypothesized that interruption of the KUCG1 gene may have contributed to mental retardation in this patient. However, sequencing of the KUCG1 gene in 10 additional Japanese families with X-linked mental retardation did not identify any mutations.",

			{
				"Description": "Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism wherein the body accumulates excess iron (summary by Feder et al., 1996). Excess iron is deposited in a variety of organs leading to their failure, and resulting in serious illnesses including cirrhosis, hepatomas, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, arthritis, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Severe effects of the disease usually do not appear until after decades of progressive iron loading. Removal of excess iron by therapeutic phlebotomy decreases morbidity and mortality if instituted early in the course of the disease. Classic hemochromatosis (HFE) is most often caused by mutation in a gene designated HFE on chromosome 6p21.3.",
				"History": "The first description of hemochromatosis is attributed to Trousseau (1865). His first patient was a 28-year-old man with severe diabetes. Trousseau wrote: 'From the time this man came into the hospital, I was struck by the almost bronzed appearance of his countenance, and the blackish color of his penis.' At autopsy the liver was found to be very large. 'The entire surface of the organ was granular; it was of a uniform grayish-yellow color; it was very dense, resisting pressure so much as to prevent penetration by the finger. It creaked under the scalpel, and the surface of the cut was granular in place of being smooth.'\n\nThe hereditary nature of hemochromatosis was emphasized particularly by Sheldon (1935). In his classic monograph entitled 'Haemochromatosis,' Sheldon (1935) reviewed references to a familial or hereditary basis of the disease made by 14 authors and stated: 'Further evidence is greatly desirable on this aspect of the disease, since the fact of an occasional familial incidence must obviously be taken into account in any theory regarding the origin of the disease.'",
				"Clinical Features": "Cazzola et al. (1983) emphasized the special characteristics of juvenile hemochromatosis: onset with abdominal pain in the first decade, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in the second decade, and cardiac arrhythmias and intractable heart failure in the third decade. Males and females are affected about equally. \n\nCazzola et al. (1983) described the disorder in an Italian brother and sister and in German identical twins. They pointed to the cases of Perkins et al. (1965), Felts et al. (1967), Charlton et al. (1967), and Lamon et al. (1979) as examples of the same disorder. \n\nAlthough the organ damage in JH is more severe, parenchymal iron distribution is similar to that in HFE, as inferred by liver biopsies or autopsy findings (Molitch and Kirkham, 1983; Haddy et al., 1988). Reports of functional studies on iron metabolism in JH are limited. Camaschella et al. (1997) cited 1 published case in which iron absorption was 100%, despite the severe iron load, a value never reached in HFE. \n\nCamaschella et al. (1997) described 7 Italian patients belonging to 5 unrelated families with features typical of JH. In 4 of the 5 families, the parents were consanguineous. Analysis of HFE gene (613609) mutations in all cases and nucleotide sequence of the gene in one case excluded the HFE gene as responsible for JH. Furthermore, segregation analysis of 6p markers closely associated with HFE showed that JH is unlinked to 6p and thus genetically distinct from HFE. \n\nCazzola et al. (1998) reported molecular studies in 2 Italian families with juvenile hemochromatosis, 1 of which was reported by Cazzola et al. (1983). Both families had an affected brother and sister. Of the 4 affected individuals, 3 presented with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism at 14 to 21 years of age. The affected male of 1 family presented with cardiac failure at 20 years of age and died at 21 years of age with congestive cardiomyopathy. All the family members examined were negative for the C282Y (613609.0001) and H63D (613609.0002) mutations of the HFE gene. Three of the patients underwent regular phlebotomies. Based on the amount of iron mobilized by bleedings, Cazzola et al. (1998) estimated that these patients had body iron stores ranging from 220 to 329 mg/kg of body weight at the time of diagnosis at 17 to 21 years of age. Based on phlebotomy requirements for maintenance of normal iron balance, the rate of estimated iron accumulation ranged from 3.2 to 3.9 mg/d. This was clearly higher than the rate of 0.8 to 1.6 mg/d found in 5 adult males homozygous for the C282Y mutation. This remarkable difference in iron overprocurement suggested completely different pathogenetic mechanisms. \n\nKelly et al. (1998) reported 4 patients (2 of each sex) from 3 pedigrees affected by juvenile hemochromatosis with a mean onset at 22 years. All had endocrine deficiency with postpubertal gonadal failure secondary to pituitary disease; 2 suffered near-fatal cardiomyopathy with heart failure. A 24-year-old man listed for heart transplantation because of cardiomyopathy responded to intravenous iron chelation with desferrioxamine combined with phlebotomy and did not require transplantation. A 27-year-old woman required orthotopic cardiac transplantation before the diagnosis was established. These 2 patients with cardiomyopathy from unrelated families were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene and did not have the H63D mutation. \n\nDe Gobbi et al. (2002) analyzed the phenotype of 29 patients with JH, from 20 families of different ethnic origin, with linkage to chromosome 1q. They also compared the clinical expression in 26 of these patients with that of 93 males homozygous for the C282Y mutation (613609.0001) and with that of 11 patients with hemochromatosis type 3 (604250), which is caused by mutation in the transferrin receptor-2 gene (TFR2; 604720). Patients with JH were statistically younger at presentation and had a more severe iron burden than C282Y homozygotes and hemochromatosis type 3 patients. They were more frequently affected by cardiopathy, hypogonadism, and reduced glucose tolerance. In contrast, cirrhosis was not statistically different among the 3 groups. The data suggested that the rapid iron accumulation in JH causes preferential tissue damage. The results clarified the natural history of the disease and were compatible with the hypothesis that the implicated gene at the HFE2 locus on 1q has greater influence on iron absorption than other hemochromatosis-associated genes. \n\nMurugan et al. (2008) reported a 23-year-old African American man of West Indies descent who was first diagnosed with iron overload at age 4 years. At that time, he had iron deposition in the liver and began treatment with phlebotomy. He developed normally as a teen but developed splenomegaly with cirrhosis and portal hypertension by age 23. However, he did not have cardiomyopathy or hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. His paternal grandparents came from Tobago and Grenada, and his maternal grandparents were from Trinidad and Grenada. There was no family history of consanguinity, iron overload, or Caucasian or white admixture. His parents and sister had normal iron phenotypes. ",

				"Description": "Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in the activity of coagulation factor VIII. The disorder is clinically heterogeneous with variable severity, depending on the plasma levels of coagulation factor VIII: mild, with levels 6 to 30% of normal; moderate, with levels 2 to 5% of normal; and severe, with levels less than 1% of normal. Patients with mild hemophilia usually bleed excessively only after trauma or surgery, whereas those with severe hemophilia have an annual average of 20 to 30 episodes of spontaneous or excessive bleeding after minor trauma, particularly into joints and muscles. These symptoms differ substantially from those of bleeding disorders due to platelet defects or von Willebrand disease (193400), in which mucosal bleeding predominates (review by Mannucci and Tuddenham, 2001)",
				"History": "Early reports of hemophilia families emanated from this country beginning with a newspaper account in 1792 (McKusick, 1962) and continuing with medical reports by Otto in 1803 and Hay in 1813 (McKusick, 1962). Cone (1979) called attention to an amazingly clear description of the genetics and rheumatic complications of hemophilia by Dr. James N. Hughes of Simpsonville, Kentucky, in 1832.\n\nAlthough the type of hemophilia, hemophilia A or hemophilia B, is not known, the occurrence of hemophilia in the last Tsar of Russia and other descendants of Queen Victoria through the maternal lines is well documented (McKusick, 1965). Gill et al. (1994) reported DNA studies on 9 skeletons found in a shallow grave in Ekaterinburg, Russia, in July 1991 and tentatively identified by Russian forensic authorities as the remains of the last Tsar, Tsarina, 3 of their 5 children, the Royal Physician and 3 servants. DNA-based sex testing and short-tandem repeat analysis confirmed that a family group was present in the grave. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed an exact sequence match between the putative Tsarina and the 3 children and a living maternal relative. Amplified mtDNA extracted from the remains of the putative Tsar demonstrated heteroplasmy at a single base within the mtDNA control region. One of these sequences matched 2 living maternal relatives of the Tsar. The DNA data indicated that 1 of the princesses and Tsarevich Alexei were missing from the grave. ",
				"Clinical Features": "Aggeler et al. (1952) described a 16-year-old white male with a hemophilia-like disorder in which there appeared to be a deficiency of a coagulation factor, which the authors called 'plasma thromboplastin component' (PTC). They cited reports indicating that blood from some patients with hemophilia was capable of correcting the coagulation defect in other cases of hemophilia in vitro. The authors concluded that these patients had a combined defect of PTC deficiency and 'true' hemophilia (hemophilia A). It was not clear at that time if the disorder was hereditary. \n\nBiggs et al. (1952) in the December 27 (Christmas) issue of the British Medical Journal reported a 5-year-old boy, with a surname of 'Christmas' who had this disorder, as well as other patients, some of whom came from families showing a typical X-linked pattern of inheritance, Biggs et al. (1952) defended the familial eponym in the following way: 'The naming of clinical disorders after patients was introduced by Sir Jonathan Hutchinson and is now familiar from serological research; it has the advantage that no hypothetical implication is attached to such a name.' Giangrande (2003) provided historical information concerning the patient Stephen Christmas (1947-1993), whose mutation in the F9 gene (300746.0109) was reported by Taylor et al. (1992) and his physicians. \n\nHemophilia B(M)\n\nA subset of hemophilia B patients have a prolonged prothrombin time when exposed to bovine (or ox) brain tissue, which serves as a source of thromboplastin, or tissue factor (F3; 134390); these CRM+ patients are classified as having hemophilia B(M) (Lefkowitz et al., 1993). \n\nSeveral workers (e.g., Nour-Eldin and Wilkinson, 1959) observed the combination of factor IX deficiency with factor VII (F7; 613878) deficiency. However, inheritance was always X-linked, even though F7 is on chromosome 13. Verstraete et al. (1962) reported 4 families in which all affected males had both Christmas disease and factor VII deficiency. The authors suggested that factor VII deficiency was a consistent secondary phenomenon; thus no separate mutation for the combined defect would be necessary. \n\nHougie and Twomey (1967) defined a variant of hemophilia B that differed from the usual form by the presence of a prolonged PT. They presented evidence these patients had a structurally abnormal and inactive form of factor IX that acted as an inhibitor of the normal reaction between factor VII and bovine brain. They called the variant hemophilia B(M), after the initial of the family surname. \n\nDenson et al. (1968) identified 3 blood samples of hemophilia B(M) among samples derived from 27 patients with Christmas disease. In a series of coagulation assays, Denson et al. (1968) demonstrated that the prolongation of the PT involved inhibition of the reaction between ox brain tissue factor, factor VII, and factor X. Noting that this distinct abnormality had only been observed in patients with factor IX deficiency, the authors postulated that the 'inhibitor' may be an abnormal protein similar to or identical with factor IX. Subsequent studies showed that this inhibitor was an abnormal form of factor IX that was functionally inactive but was antigenically indistinguishable from normal factor IX. \n\nLefkowitz et al. (1993) noted that the bovine brain tissue in studies of hemophilia B(M) is the source of thromboplastin, or tissue factor (F3; 134390); PT times determined with thromboplastin from rabbit brain or human brain are not reported to be prolonged. However, in various studies of factor IX Hilo (300746.0031), Lefkowitz et al. (1993) found that either normal F9 or Hilo F9 prolonged the PT regardless of the tissue factor source, but the prolongation required high concentrations of factor IX when rabbit or human brain was used. With bovine thromboplastin, factor IX Hilo was significantly better than normal factor IX at prolonging the PT. In addition, the prolongation times depended on the amounts of factors IX and X used in the assays. \n\nHemophilia B Leyden\n\nVeltkamp et al. (1970) described a variant of hemophilia B, termed hemophilia B Leyden, in a Dutch family. The disorder was characterized by the disappearance of the bleeding diathesis as the patient aged. In affected individuals, plasma factor IX levels were less than 1% of normal before puberty, but after puberty factor IX activity and antigen levels rose steadily in a 1:1 ratio to a maximum of 50 to 60%. \n\nBriet et al. (1982) described a similar variant of hemophilia B that took a severe form early in life but remitted after puberty, with an increase in factor IX levels from below 1% of normal to about 50% of normal by age 80 years. Three pedigrees with 27 affected males with this disorder could be traced to a small village in the east of the Netherlands. \n\nIn affected members of 2 Dutch pedigrees with hemophilia B Leyden, Reitsma et al. (1988) found that patients with hemophilia B Leyden had a mutation in the promoter region of the F9 gene (300746.0001). The findings suggested that a point mutation could lead to a switch from constitutive to steroid hormone-dependent gene expression. The families were probably related. \n\nMandalaki et al. (1986) reported a 5-generation Greek family with hemophilia B. The factor IX levels in the 3 patients from the last generation were extremely low, while those of patients in the older generations were much higher. In 1 patient, the rise of factor IX levels appeared between ages 13 and 14 years. In addition, older patients in the family had much milder symptoms compared to the younger patients. The phenotype was similar to hemophilia B Leyden as described by Veltkamp et al. (1970). \n\nManifesting Females\n\nLascari et al. (1969) described a daughter of a male with hemophilia B who had an XX karyotype, factor IX level of 5%, and hemarthrosis. The factor IX level in the mother was 100%. The girl was thought to be a manifesting heterozygote with unfortunate lyonization. \n\nSpinelli et al. (1976) observed deletion of the short arm of 1 of the X chromosomes in a female with hemophilia B. Family investigations were negative. Hashimi et al. (1978) reported a girl with Christmas disease. Her father was affected, and her parents were related as first cousins, suggesting possible homozygosity for the defect. They referred to a similar instance of plausible homozygosity. \n\nWadelius et al. (1993) reported a female with hemophilia B with factor IX activity of about 1%. Her father had severe hemophilia B. No chromosomal abnormality could be detected, and DNA analysis gave no indication of deletions or mutations of TaqI cleavage sites in the F9 gene. Analysis of the methylation pattern of locus DXS255 indicated that the expression of hemophilia B in this girl was caused by nonrandom X inactivation. \n\nVianna-Morgante et al. (1986) observed de novo t(X;1)(q27;q23) in a girl with hemophilia B who had no affected relatives. In a full description of the case, Krepischi-Santos et al. (2001) stated that the translocated X was preferentially active and that methylation analysis of the DXS255 locus confirmed the skewed X inactivation with the paternal allele being the active one. Molecular analysis showed deletion of at least part of the F9 gene. \n\nNisen et al. (1986) described hemophilia B in a girl with the karyotype 46,X,del(X)q27. They showed that the X chromosome with the deletion was inactivated in all cells. The mother's identical twin sister had a son with severe hemophilia B. The proband was also lacking the paternal factor VIII gene, indicating that the deletion had occurred in the paternal X chromosome and had included the factor VIII locus. However, both the maternal and the paternal factor IX loci were present. The interpretation applied by Nisen et al. (1986) was that inactivation of the deleted, paternally derived X chromosome in all cells had provided the opportunity for expression of the hemophilia B gene which the proband had inherited from her mother. \n\nBy sequencing the complete factor IX gene in 2 sisters with hemophilia B with different phenotypes and no family history of hemorrhagic diathesis, Costa et al. (2000) found a common 5-prime splice site mutation in intron 3 (300746.0107) and an additional missense mutation (I344T; 300746.0108) in 1 sister. The presence of dysfunctional antigen in the latter strongly suggested that these mutations were in trans. Neither mutation was found in leukocyte DNA from the asymptomatic parents, but the mother was a somatic mosaic for the shared splice site mutation. The somatic mosaicism in the mother for the splice site mutation was demonstrated by studies of buccal and uroepithelial cells. The missense mutation was presumed to have resulted from a de novo mutation in the father's gametes. The compound heterozygous proband was a 14-year-old girl with moderate hemophilia B, manifest by hematomas, hemarthrosis, and epistaxis. A sister suffered only from rare hematomas. \n\nIn a population-based survey in the Netherlands, Plug et al. (2006) found that female carriers of hemophilia A and B bled more frequently than noncarrier women, especially after medical procedures, such as tooth extraction or tonsillectomy. Reduced clotting factor levels correlated with a mild hemophilia phenotype. Variation in clotting levels was attributed to lyonization. \n",
				"Diagnosis": "In a patient with severe F9 deficiency who developed an inhibitor, Peake et al. (1984) detected a deletion in the F9 gene using 4 genomic gene probes. Similar studies of 8 female relatives using this method identified 2 as carriers. Used a genomic probe containing a TaqI polymorphism in the F9 gene, Giannelli et al. (1984) successfully identified carriers of Christmas disease in 3 affected families. \n\nIn eukaryotic DNA, a high proportion of CpG dinucleotides are methylated at the cytosine residue to give 5-methylcytosine. The restriction enzyme HhaI will not cleave at methylated CpG sites, but PCR can overcome this limitation. Winship et al. (1989) used PCR to detect a polymorphic HhaI site located 8 kb 3-prime to the F9 gene and estimated that almost half of female subjects can be expected to be heterozygous at this site. Detection of this marker using PCR was predicted to increase the proportion of persons in whom the carrier state of hemophilia B could be diagnosed, compared to using the restriction enzyme alone, which could be influenced by methylation status. \n\nKoeberl et al. (1990) compared RFLP-based carrier detection of an X-linked disease with a direct method involving genomic amplification with transcript sequencing (GAWTS). They pointed out that the RFLP approach 'suffers from multiple levels of uncertainty.' They found that 22 at-risk females were diagnosed by direct testing, whereas only 11 females could be diagnosed by standard RFLP analysis. \n\nGiannelli et al. (1992) used hemophilia B as a model of a genetic disease with marked mutational heterogeneity to lay out an overall strategy for genetic counseling. They started with the construction of a national database which could be used for diagnosis and genetic counseling on the basis of DNA abnormality. In the U.K. there were just over 1,000 patients with hemophilia B and these were probably derived from 500 to 600 families. They characterized the mutation in a group of unrelated patients and in only 1 of 170 patients examined from the Swedish and British series did they fail to find a mutation in the essential regions of the gene. Thus the screening procedures used were capable of detecting all types of mutations. By phenotype/genotype correlations the authors generated information of prognostic value concerning each of those mutations. \n\nPrenatal Diagnosis\n\nIn 5 kindreds studied in detail, Poon et al. (1987) were able to determine the carrier status of hemophilia B in all 11 females at risk; prenatal diagnosis could be offered to the offspring of each of the 6 carriers identified. \n\nGreen et al. (1991) suggested a strategy for facilitating carrier and prenatal diagnosis by identification of all hemophilia B mutations in a given population so that only the relevant parts of the molecule need be focused on when performing amplification mismatch detection (AMD) as developed by Montandon et al. (1989). ",

			{
				"Description": "Neurofibromatosis type I is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cafe-au-lait spots, Lisch nodules in the eye, and fibromatous tumors of the skin. Individuals with the disorder have increased susceptibility to the development of benign and malignant tumors. NF1 is sometimes referred to as 'peripheral neurofibromatosis.' The worldwide incidence of NF1 is 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 3,000 individuals (reviews by Shen et al., 1996 and Williams et al., 2009).\n\nType II neurofibromatosis (NF2; 101000) is a genetically distinct disorder caused by mutation in the gene encoding merlin (NF2; 607379) on chromosome 22q12. NF2, sometimes known as 'central neurofibromatosis,' is characterized by bilateral acoustic neuroma and meningioma, but few skin lesions or neurofibromas (Rouleau et al., 1993). ",
				"History": "Although the Elephant Man (Howell and Ford, 1980) has often been thought to have had von Recklinghausen disease, it has been suggested (Pyeritz, 1987) that Proteus syndrome (176920) is a more likely diagnosis. After considering several diagnostic possibilities, Cohen (1988) also concluded that the skeletal findings in Joseph Merrick are most consistent with Proteus syndrome. He pointed out that the 'moccasin' lesions of the feet are particularly characteristic of that disorder. See the study of the case of Joseph Merrick by Graham and Oehlschlaeger (1992).\n\nRuggieri and Polizzi (2003) found several historical examples of what they interpreted as mosaicism in neurofibromatosis. They suggested that the segmental lesions can be limited either to the affected area showing the same degree of severity as that found in the corresponding nonmosaic trait (type 1 segmental involvement) or may be markedly more pronounced and superimposed on a milder, nonsegmental, heterozygous manifestation of the same trait (type 2 segmental involvement).",
				"Clinical Features": "Gardner and Frazier (1933) reported a family of 5 generations in which 38 members were deaf because of bilateral acoustic neuromas; of these, 15 later became blind. The average age at onset of deafness was 20 years. The average age at death of affected persons in the second generation was 72, in the third generation 63, in the fourth 42, and in the fifth 28. Follow-up of this family (Gardner and Turner, 1940; Young et al., 1970) revealed no evidence of the systemic manifestations of neurofibromatosis I (NF1; 162200), also known as von Recklinghausen disease. Other families with no evidence of the latter disease were reported by Worster-Drought et al. (1937), Feiling and Ward (1920), and Moyes (1968). Worster-Drought et al. (1937) pointed out that Wishart (1822) was the first to report a case of bilateral acoustic neuroma. Wishart's patient, Michael Blair, was 21 years old when he consulted Mr. Wishart, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, because of bilateral deafness. He had a peculiarly shaped head from infancy, and blindness in the right eye was discovered at about 4 months after birth. He became completely blind and deaf toward the end of his life. Autopsy revealed tumors of the dura mater and brain and also a 'tumour of the size of a small nut, and very hard, being attached to each of them (auditory nerves), just where they enter the meatus auditorius internus.' \n\nNager (1969) showed that in about 4% of cases acoustic neuroma is bilateral. In addition to their autosomal dominant inheritance and association with neurofibromatosis, bilateral tumors differ from unilateral ones in that they can reach a remarkably large size with extensive involvement of the temporal bone and the nerves therein. Fabricant et al. (1979) reported that more than 30 kindreds with 'central neurofibromatosis' had been described. Most patients with the central form (NF2) have no cafe-au-lait spots or peripheral neurofibromata, and no patients in one large series had 6 or more cafe-au-lait spots (Eldridge, 1981). \n\nKanter et al. (1980), who reviewed 9 personally studied kindreds and 15 reported ones, with a total of 130 cases, showed an increase only in antigenic activity of nerve growth factor (NGF; 162030) in central neurofibromatosis and only in functional activity in peripheral neurofibromatosis. \n\nIn a series reported by Mrazek et al. (1988), 1 of 41 acoustic neurinoma cases was bilateral. This was in a 10-year-old girl with von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis, whose first tumor had been diagnosed at age 6. \n\nMayfrank et al. (1990) studied 10 patients with NF2 and found that all were sporadic cases, each presumably the result of a new mutational event. From a survey of these patients and those in the literature, they concluded that sporadic cases are characterized by a high incidence of multiple meningiomas and spinal tumors in addition to bilateral acoustic neurinomas. \n\nPulst et al. (1991) described a family with spinal neurofibromatosis without cafe-au-lait spots or other manifestations of either NF1 or NF2 such as cutaneous tumors, Lisch nodules, or acoustic tumors. Mutation at the NF1 locus was excluded with odds greater than 100,000:1. Markers with the NF2 locus were uninformative in this family. \n\nEvans et al. (1992, 1992) studied 150 patients. The mean age at onset was 21.57 years (n = 110) and no patient presented after 55 years of age. Patients presented with symptoms attributable to vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuroma), cranial meningiomas, and spinal tumors. In 100 patients studied personally by the authors, 44 presented with deafness, which was unilateral in 35. Deafness was accompanied by tinnitus in 10. Muscle weakness or wasting was the first symptom in 12%. In 3 of the 100 patients, there was a distal symmetrical sensorimotor neuropathy, confirmed by nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Although similar features may result from the multiple spinal and intracranial tumors that occur in this condition, a generalized and isolated neuropathy appears to be a relatively common feature of NF2. Cafe-au-lait spots occurred in 43 of the 100 patients but only 1 had as many as 6 spots. Cataract was detected in 34 of 90 patients. Cataracts were probably congenital in 4 patients in this study. Three types of skin tumors were recognized. The first and least common was similar to the intradermal papillary skin neurofibroma with violaceous coloring occurring in NF1. The second type comprised subcutaneous well-circumscribed, often spherical, tumors that appeared to be located on peripheral nerves; the thickened nerve could often be palpated at either end of the tumor, the skin being mobile and separate from the tumor. The third and most frequent type, first described by Martuza and Eldridge (1988), was represented by discrete well-circumscribed, slightly raised, roughened areas of skin often pigmented and accompanied by excess hair. Skin tumors of some kind were found in 68% of patients, type 1 being present in 20%, type 2 in 33%, and type 3 in 47%. They could find no evidence that either pregnancy or contraceptive pills has adverse effects on vestibular schwannomas or other manifestations. Evans et al. (1992) provided useful advice on the follow-up of persons identified as having NF2 and the management of persons at risk of developing NF2. \n\nEvans et al. (1992) divided their 120 cases of NF2 into 2 types: the Wishart (1822) type, with early onset, rapid course, and multiple other tumors in addition to bilateral vestibular schwannomas, and the Gardner type (1930, 1933, 1940), with late onset, more benign course, and usually only bilateral vestibular schwannomas. This classification had been suggested by Eldridge et al. (1991). Evans et al. (1992) found no evidence for the existence of a third type of generalized meningiomatosis that might be designated the Lee-Abbott type (Lee and Abbott, 1969). The age at onset of deafness and the age at diagnosis were almost identical in the 2 sexes. Birth incidence of NF2 was estimated to be 1 in 33,000-40,562. Evans et al. (1992) considered 49% of the 150 cases to represent new mutations. The mutation rate was estimated to be 6.5 x 10(-6). A maternal effect on severity was noted in that age of onset was 18.17 years in 36 maternally inherited cases and 24.5 years in 20 paternally inherited cases (p = 0.027). A preponderance of maternally inherited cases was also significant (p = 0.03). (A maternal effect on severity had been noted also for NF1.) Baser et al. (2001) studied 140 patients and found that maternal inheritance was not an independent correlate of NF2 disease severity. \n\nParry et al. (1994) assessed possible heterogeneity in NF2 by evaluating 63 affected members of 32 families. In addition to skin and neurologic examinations, workup included audiometry, complete ophthalmologic examination with slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the lens and fundus, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and, in some, of the spine. Mean age-at-onset in 58 individuals was 20.3 years; initial symptoms were related to vestibular schwannomas (44.4%), other CNS tumors (22.2%), skin tumors (12.7%), and ocular manifestations including cataracts and retinal hamartomas (12.7%). Screening uncovered 5 affected but asymptomatic family members; vestibular schwannomas were demonstrated in 62 (98.4%). Other findings included cataracts (81.0%), skin tumors (67.7%), spinal tumors (67.4%), and meningiomas (49.2%). As a rule, clinical manifestations and clinical course were similar within families but differed among families. Parry et al. (1994) concluded that 2 subtypes but not 3 can be defined. \n\nEvans et al. (1999) studied the presentation of NF2 in childhood. A total of 334 cases of NF2 were identified from a comprehensive UK dataset, of which 61 (18%) had presented in childhood (0-15 years). Twenty-six of these children presented with symptoms of vestibular schwannoma, 19 with meningioma, 7 with a spinal tumor, and 5 with a cutaneous tumor. In addition, Evans et al. (1999) identified 22 children with a meningioma from the Manchester Children's Tumor Registry, a prospective database of children presenting with a tumor since 1954 within a defined population. At least 3 of these children subsequently developed classic NF2, and in none of them was there a family history suggestive of NF2. The authors concluded that NF2 should be considered in any child presenting with meningioma, vestibular schwannoma, or cutaneous symptoms such as neurofibroma or schwannoma, especially if they have fewer than 6 cafe-au-lait patches and therefore do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for NF1. \n\nGijtenbeek et al. (2001) reported a patient with NF2, confirmed by genetic analysis, who presented with an axonal mononeuropathy multiplex with progression of axonal loss over several years. Sural nerve biopsy showed small scattered groups of Schwann cells transformed into irregular branching cells with abnormal cell-cell contacts. The authors hypothesized that defective Schwann cell function, due to inactivation of the NF2 gene product merlin, leads to changes in morphology, cell-cell contact, and growth, and finally to degeneration of axons. \n\nEgan et al. (2001) reported 4 cases of NF2 with a monocular elevator paresis. Two of the patients had third nerve tumors demonstrable on MRI, which had not been present on earlier films. The other 2 patients may have had tumors too small for radiographic detection. The authors suggested that the isolated paresis may result from compression of particular fascicles of the third nerve that subserve the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles as they exit the midbrain, and noted that ocular mobility defects should be closely monitored in patients with NF2. \n\nTo evaluate clinical and molecular predictors of the risk of mortality in persons with NF2, Baser et al. (2002) analyzed the mortality experience of 368 patients from 261 families in the United Kingdom NF2 registry. Age at diagnosis, intracranial meningiomas, and type of treatment center were informative predictors of the risk of mortality. The relative risk of mortality increased 1.13-fold per year decrease in age at diagnosis and was 2.51-fold greater in people with meningiomas compared with those without meningiomas. The relative risk of mortality in patients treated at specialty centers was 0.34, compared with those treated at nonspecialty centers. The relative risk of mortality in people with constitutional NF2 missense mutations was very low compared with those with other types of mutations (nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations, and large deletions), but the confidence interval could not be quantified because there was only 1 death among people with missense mutations. \n\nOcular Abnormalities\n\nPearson-Webb et al. (1986) pointed out that Lisch nodules, which are iris hamartomas that are frequently found in NF1, are not found in NF2. They found, however, an apparently high frequency of presenile posterior subcapsular and nuclear cataracts which sometimes required surgery and/or predated the symptoms of bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis. Landau et al. (1990) described combined pigment epithelial and retinal hamartoma (CEPRH) in NF2. \n\nKaiser-Kupfer et al. (1989) found posterior capsular lens opacities in 20 NF2 patients in 11 families. Parry et al. (1991) extended these observations. In 26 persons who were first-degree relatives of an affected individual, they found posterior capsular cataracts in 21. Of 14 at-risk individuals, i.e., persons with mild changes of NF but not NF1, persons under age 40 with unilateral acoustic neuroma, a child with meningioma and/or schwannoma, and a person with multiple meningioma, they found posterior capsular lens opacities in 13. These patients probably represented new mutations. The presence of posterior capsular opacities in a relative of persons with NF2 was suggestive of NF2. Furthermore, NF2 should be considered in young persons without NF1 but with mild skin findings of NF or CNS tumors with posterior capsular opacities. Bouzas et al. (1993) found posterior subcapsular/capsular cataracts in 36 (80%) of 45 affected individuals in 29 families. In addition, the association of peripheral cortical lens opacities with NF2 was found to be statistically significant: such cataracts were found in 17 of the patients (37.8%) but in none of the unaffected family members (p less than 0.0001). In 3 patients, peripheral cortical opacities were present despite the absence of posterior subcapsular/capsular cataracts. Bouzas et al. (1993), reporting further on the NIH experience, reviewed visual impairment in 54 NF2 patients, 51 of whom had bilateral vestibular schwannomas. Causes of decreased vision were cataracts, damage in the optic pathways, macular hamartomas, and corneal opacities. Although lens opacities are an important marker for NF2, they usually do not interfere with vision; some progress, requiring cataract extraction. In 6 patients, decreased visual acuity was due to corneal opacifications secondary to either seventh or fifth cranial nerve damage, or both. Damage to the seventh cranial nerve caused lagophthalmos and decreased lacrimal secretion; damage to the fifth cranial nerve caused corneal hypesthesia. The nerves were damaged by the growth of vestibular tumors in 1 patient, but in most patients they were damaged during neurosurgical procedures. \n\nRagge et al. (1995) concluded that the most common ocular abnormalities in NF2 are posterior subcapsular or capsular, cortical, or mixed lens opacities, found in 33 of 49 patients (67%), and retinal hamartomas found in 11 of 49 patients (22%). The types of cataract that were most suggestive of NF2 were plaque-like posterior subcapsular or capsular cataract and cortical cataract with onset under the age of 30 years. \n\nBaser et al. (2003) confirmed the high prevalence of cataracts in young NF2 patients. They suggested that the frequent occurrence of cataracts before the tumor manifestations of NF2 indicated the usefulness of this non-eighth nerve feature in the diagnosis of NF2 in children and adolescents. \n\nMcLaughlin et al. (2007) identified 3 types of NF2-associated ocular manifestations: juvenile posterior subcapsular cataract, epiretinal membrane, and intrascleral schwannoma. Their histopathologic analysis revealed that dysplastic lens cells accumulated just anterior to the posterior lens capsule in juvenile posterior subcapsular cataract, and that dysplastic Muller cells might be a major component of NF2-associated epiretinal membrane. McLaughlin et al. (2007) concluded that their findings suggested that a subset of glial cells with epithelial features (Schwann cells, ependymal cells, and Muller cells) might be particularly sensitive to loss of the NF2 gene.",
				"Diagnosis": "In a review of NF2, Martuza and Eldridge (1988) defined criteria for the diagnosis of both NF1 and NF2. An NIH Consensus Development Conference (1988) concluded that the criteria for NF2 are met if a person is found to have '(1) bilateral eighth nerve masses seen with appropriate imaging techniques (e.g., CT or MRI); or (2) a first-degree relative with NF2 and either unilateral eighth nerve mass, or two of the following: neurofibroma, meningioma, glioma, schwannoma, or juvenile posterior subcapsular lenticular opacity.' Pastores et al. (1991) demonstrated that small (less than 8 mm) acoustic neuromas can be detected in asymptomatic individuals by the use of gadolinium-enhanced MRI. They demonstrated such neuromas in 2 asymptomatic children, aged 7 and 11 years, one of whom had normal audiometric and brainstem-evoked response testing. \n\nUsing polymorphic DNA markers in a study of 13 NF2 kindreds, Ruttledge et al. (1993) concluded that it is possible to determine, with a high degree of certainty, the carrier status of about 85% of persons at risk. Risk prediction was possible in every case in which DNA was available from both parents. In 76% of informative individuals, it was possible to assign a decreased risk of being carriers. Thus, the use of probes for construction of chromosome 22 haplotypes for risk assessment should result in a greatly reduced number of individuals who will require periodic screening. \n\nGutmann et al. (1997) provided guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation and multidisciplinary management of both NF1 and NF2. The criteria for definite NF2 were bilateral vestibular schwannomas; or family history of NF2 in 1 or more first-degree relative(s) plus (a) unilateral vestibular schwannomas at age less than 30 years, or (b) any two of the following: meningioma, glioma, schwannoma, or juvenile posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities/juvenile cortical cataract. The criteria for presumptive or probable NF2 was unilateral vestibular schwannomas at age less than 30 years, plus at least one of the following: meningioma, glioma, schwannoma, or juvenile posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities/juvenile cortical cataract; or multiple meningiomas (two or more) plus (a) unilateral vestibular schwannomas at age less than 30 years, or (b) one of the following: glioma, schwannoma, or juvenile posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities/juvenile cortical cataract. \n\nKluwe et al. (2000) studied 40 skin tumors (36 schwannomas and 4 neurofibromas) from 20 NF2 patients, 15 of whom had NF2 mutations previously identified in blood leukocytes. The detection rate of constitutional mutations was higher in patients with skin tumors (65%) than in patients without skin tumors (40%). Alterations in both NF2 alleles were found in 17 (43%) of the tumors. They concluded that loss of a functional NF2 gene product is a critical event in the generation of skin schwannomas and that mutation detection in skin tumors may be a useful diagnostic tool in patients with skin tumors where the clinical diagnosis of NF2 is ambiguous, or in unclear cases in which NF1 must be excluded. \n\nBaser et al. (2002) evaluated 4 previous sets of clinical diagnostic criteria for NF2 developed by groups of experts: the NIH Consensus Development Conference (1988), the Consensus Development Panel (1994) of the NIH, the Manchester Group criteria reported by Evans et al. (1992), and the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation (NNFF) criteria reported by Gutmann et al. (1997). Baser et al. (2002) concluded that none of the existing sets of criteria was adequate at initial assessment for diagnosing people who present without bilateral vestibular schwannomas, particularly people with a negative family history of NF2. \n\nBaser et al. (2011) empirically developed and tested an improved set of diagnostic criteria that used understanding of the natural history and genetic characteristics of NF2 to increase sensitivity while maintaining very high specificity. They used data from the UK Neurofibromatosis 2 Registry and Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate frequencies of clinical features at various ages among patients with or without unequivocal NF2. On the basis of this analysis, Baser et al. (2011) developed the Baser criteria, a diagnostic system that incorporates genetic testing and gives more weight to the most characteristic features and to those that occur before 30 years of age. In an independent validation subset of patients with unequivocal NF2, the Baser criteria increased diagnostic sensitivity to 79% (9-15% greater than previous sets of criteria) while maintaining 100% specificity at the age of onset of the first characteristic sign of NF2. \n\nMosaicism in NF2\n\nEvans et al. (2007) showed that the chances of a de novo patient with NF2 being mosaic for the underlying mutation in the NF2 gene increased with age at presentation with vestibular schwannoma and was particularly high in patients with unilateral presentation of vestibular schwannoma, but who still had at least 2 further NF2-related tumors in order to fulfill the Manchester criteria. \n\nEvans and Wallace (2009) analyzed the mosaic risk in de novo patients with NF2 by age at the time of vestibular schwannoma diagnosis. They analyzed this risk in 4 age cohorts to derive figures for mosaicism and offspring risk both before and after lymphocyte DNA testing with sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. The study was based on actual genetic testing of lymphocyte DNA in 402 de novo patients and subsequent tumor testing in 51 patients with negative blood analysis. The risk of NF2 to an offspring of a patient presenting with bilateral vestibular schwannoma at less than 20 years of age was 29.3%, whereas the offspring risk for a patient presenting with asymmetric disease after 40 years of age was only 5.5%, as there is a 99% chance that they are mosaic.

				"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations": "Parry et al. (1996) identified mutations in the NF2 gene in 66% of 32 patients; 20 different mutations were found in 21 patients. They suggested that their results confirmed the association between nonsense and frameshift mutations and clinical manifestations compatible with severe disease. They stated that their data raised questions regarding the role of other factors, in addition to the intrinsic properties of individual mutations, that might influence the phenotype. Ruttledge et al. (1996) reported that when individuals harboring protein-truncating mutations are compared with patients having single codon alterations, a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) with clinical outcome is observed. They noted that 24 of 28 patients with mutations that cause premature termination of the NF2 protein presented with severe phenotypes. In contrast, all 16 cases from 3 families with mutations that affect only a single amino acid had mild NF2. \n\nEvans et al. (1998) reported 42 cases of NF2 from 38 families with truncating mutations. The average age of onset of symptoms was 19 years and age at diagnosis 22.4 years. Fifty-one cases from 16 families (15 with splice site mutations, 18 with missense mutations, and 18 with large deletions) had an average age of onset of 27.8 years and age at diagnosis of 33.4 years. Subjects with truncating mutations were significantly more likely to develop symptoms before 20 years of age (p less than 0.001) and to develop at least 2 symptomatic CNS tumors in addition to vestibular schwannoma before 30 years (p less than 0.001). There were significantly fewer multigenerational families with truncating mutations. \n\nKehrer-Sawatzki et al. (1997) reported a patient with NF2 and a ring chromosome 22 (46,XX,r(22)/45,XX,-22). Severe manifestations included multiple meningiomas, spinal and peripheral neurinomas, and bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The patient was also severely mentally retarded, a feature not usually associated with NF2. The authors hypothesized that a mutation in the NF2 gene of the normal chromosome 22, in addition to the loss of the ring 22 in many cells during mitosis, could explain the presence of multiple tumors. Using a meningioma cell line lacking the ring chromosome, Kehrer-Sawatzki et al. (1997) searched for deletions, rearrangements, or other mutations of the NF2 gene on the normal chromosome 22; no such alterations were found. The authors concluded that the loss of the entire chromosome 22 and its multiple tumor suppressor genes may have led to the severe phenotype in this patient. \n\nIn 406 patients from the population-based United Kingdom NF2 registry, Baser et al. (2004) evaluated genotype/phenotype correlations for various types of non-VIII nerve tumors using regression models with the additional covariates of current age and type of treatment center (specialty or nonspecialty). The models also permitted consideration of intrafamilial correlation. The authors found statistically significant genotype/phenotype correlations for intracranial meningiomas, spinal tumors, and peripheral nerve tumors. People with constitutional NF2 missense mutations, splice site mutations, large deletions, or somatic mosaicism had significantly fewer tumors than did people with constitutional nonsense or frameshift NF2 mutations. In addition, there were significant intrafamilial correlations for intracranial meningiomas and spinal tumors, after adjustment for the type of constitutional NF2 mutation. Baser et al. (2004) concluded that the type of constitution NF2 mutation is an important determinant of the number of NF2-associated intracranial meningiomas, spinal tumors, and peripheral nerve tumors. \n\nIn 831 patients from 528 NF2 families, Baser et al. (2005) analyzed location of splice site mutations and severity of NF2, using age at onset of symptoms and number of intracranial meningiomas as indicators. They found that individuals with splice site mutations in exons 1 to 5 had more severe disease than those with splice site mutations in exons 11 to 15. Baser et al. (2005) confirmed the previously reported observation that missense mutations are usually associated with mild NF2. "

		"Title": "Phenylketonuria",
		"Entry": "OMIM Entry: #261600",
		"AKA": "AKA: Folling Disease",
		"Contents": [
			{
				"Description": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism resulting from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH; 612349), an enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine, the rate-limiting step in phenylalanine catabolism. If undiagnosed and untreated, phenylketonuria can result in impaired postnatal cognitive development resulting from a neurotoxic effect of hyperphenylalaninemia (Zurfluh et al., 2008).",
				"History": "Folling (1934) in Norway first described PKU under the designation oligophrenica phenylpyruvica. Jervis (1947) localized the metabolic error as an inability to oxidize phenylalanine to tyrosine, and Jervis (1953) demonstrated deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase in the liver of a patient.\n\nGuthrie (1996) gave a history of his introduction of newborn screening for PKU. A shift in his research from cancer research to the study of mental retardation had been prompted by the birth of his second child with mental retardation. He learned that the phenylalanine-restricted diet introduced for treatment of PKU required close monitoring of blood Phe levels for which the methods were then laborious. He conceived of modifying the bacterial test he was using to screen for different substances in the blood of patients who were being treated for cancer. These tests relied on 'competitive inhibition;' a compound that normally prevented growth of bacteria in culture plates no longer inhibited the growth when large amounts of Phe was present in a blood spot that was added to the plate. The birth of a niece who was found to have PKU at the age of 15 months also had an influence on his research. Since a positive ferric chloride urine test came too late to prevent her mental retardation, he became interested in developing a blood test for neonates. He had been using filter paper discs soaked in serum from the patient to be studied. He found, however, that whole blood worked equally well and facilitated newborn screening. Newborn screening with the heel stick began in 1961 and was reported by Guthrie and Susi (1963). In the first 2 years, 400,000 infants were tested in 29 states and 39 cases of PKU were found--an incidence of about 1 per 10,000. None was missed by screening. Guthrie (1996) noted that the National Association for Retarded Children through its state chapters lobbied vigorously for laws for PKU screening despite much opposition by organized medical groups; 37 states had such laws by 1967.\n\nBickel (1996) described his first introduction to the disease PKU in 1949 at the University Children's Hospital Zurich where Professor G. Fanconi instructed Bickel to perform the ferric chloride test in every retarded patient. Later, on moving to the University Children's Hospital in Birmingham, he introduced the ferric chloride test there and found a patient whose mother urged him to find a way to help the daughter. Under the pressure of this mother, Bickel, Gerrard, and Hickmans (Bickel et al., 1953) speculated that there might be a causal relation between the Phe excess in the biologic fluids and the girl's brain damage and that it might be possible to improve her condition by reducing Phe intake. The use of a Phe-restricted casein hydrolysate as the main protein source of the diet was considered. Early results were dramatic.",
				"Clinical Features": "Early diagnosis of phenylketonuria, a cause of mental retardation, is important because it is treatable by dietary means. Features other than mental retardation in untreated patients include a 'mousy' odor; light pigmentation; peculiarities of gait, stance, and sitting posture; eczema; and epilepsy (Paine, 1957). Kawashima et al. (1988) suggested that cataracts and brain calcification may be frequently overlooked manifestations of classic untreated PKU. Brain calcification has been reported in dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency (261630). Pitt and O'Day (1991) found only 3 persons with cataracts among 46 adults, aged 28 to 71 years, with untreated PKU. They concluded that PKU is not a cause of cataracts. Levy et al. (1970) screened the serum of 280,919 'normal' teenagers and adults whose blood had been submitted for syphilis testing. Only 3 adults with the biochemical findings of PKU were found. Each was mentally subnormal. Normal mentality is very rare among patients with phenylketonuria who have not received dietary therapy. \n\nEvidence of heterogeneity in phenylketonuria was presented by Auerbach et al. (1967) and by Woolf et al. (1968). \n\nCoskun et al. (1990) observed scleroderma in 2 infants with PKU. Improvement in the skin lesions after commencement of a low phenylalanine diet supported the possibility of a causal relationship. \n\nWidespread screening of neonates for phenylketonuria brought to light a class of patients with a disorder of phenylalanine metabolism milder than that in PKU. These patients show serum phenylalanine concentrations well below those in PKU, but still several times the normal. PKU and hyperphenylalaninemia breed true in families (Kaufman et al., 1975), each behaving as an autosomal recessive. Kaufman et al. (1975) studied liver biopsies from patients with HPA and their parents. The patients with HPA had levels of phenylalanine hydroxylase about 5% of normal. \n\nBurgard et al. (1996) found that all patients but one who had predicted in vitro residual enzyme activity greater than 20% had mild PKU, while those with predicted in vitro residual enzyme activity less than 20% were identified as having classical PKU. The authors stated that 'the difficulties of some patients to adjust their blood Phe level according to their target value although they comply with the dietary recommendations might be caused by low residual enzyme activity.' In addition, when considering the R261Q (612349.0006) mutation (a mutation with a considerable amount of residual enzyme activity, which produced higher Phe levels than expected), they hypothesized a negative intraallelic complementation effect as an explanation for higher than expected diagnostic Phe values. \n\nMildly depressed IQ is common in treated PKU. Griffiths et al. (2000) analyzed IQ scores collected from 57 British children with early-treated classic PKU using variants of the Wechsler intelligence scale for children (WISC) in relation to indicators of dietary control such as serum phenylalanine levels and socioeconomic factors. The authors found that, after correcting for socioeconomic status, phenylalanine control at age 2 was predictive of overall IQ, although early and continuous treatment did not necessarily lead to normalization of overall IQ. Subscale analysis revealed normalized verbal IQ in those children with phenylalanine levels of less than 360 micromol/l during infancy (the recommended UK upper limit), but performance IQ remained depressed. \n\nWeglage et al. (2000) compared 42 PKU patients, aged 10 to 18 years, with 42 diabetic patients matched for sex, age, and socioeconomic status. Patients' groups were compared with a control sample of healthy controls (2,900 individuals) from an epidemiologic study. The Child Behavior Check List, IQ tests, and monitoring of blood phenylalanine concentrations and HBA1 concentrations were used. Weglage et al. (2000) found that internalizing problems such as depressive mood, anxiety, physical complaints, or social isolation were significantly elevated in both PKU and diabetic patients, whereas externalizing problems were not. The 2 patient groups did not differ significantly either in the degree or in the pattern of their psychologic profile. \n\nIn a retrospective study from birth in 13 patients with classic PKU, Barat et al. (2002) found greater variation of phenylalanine levels and a higher mean of cumulative variations in the 8 osteopenic patients than in 5 nonosteopenic patients. Barat et al. (2002) suggested that serum phenylalanine variations may contribute to osteopenia in patients with classic PKU. \n\nCrujeiras et al. (2015) conducted a cross-sectional observational multicenter study that included 156 patients with hyperphenylalaninemia. Prealbumin was reduced in 34.6% of patients (74% with PKU phenotype and 94% below 18 years old), showing an adequate adherence to diet in nearly all patients (96.3%). Selenium was diminished in 25% of patients (95% with PKU phenotype), and 25-OHD in 14%. Surprisingly, folic acid levels were increased in 39% of patients, 66% with classic PKU. Phosphorus and B12 levels were diminished only in patients with low adherence to diet. \n\nMaternal Phenylketonuria\n\nThe occurrence of mental retardation in the offspring of homozygous mothers is an example of a genetic disease based on the genotype of the mother. Kerr et al. (1968) demonstrated 'fetal PKU' by administering large amounts of phenylalanine to mother monkeys. The offspring had reduced learning ability. They pointed out that the damage is aggravated by the normal placental process which functions to maintain higher levels of amino acids in the fetus than in the mother. Huntley and Stevenson (1969) and Hanley et al. (1987) reviewed the subject of PKU embryofetopathy, also known as the maternal PKU syndrome. \n\nHuntley and Stevenson (1969) described 2 sisters with PKU who had a total of 28 pregnancies. Sixteen ended in spontaneous first-trimester abortion. The fetus in each of the 12 pregnancies carried to term had intrauterine growth retardation and microcephaly and 9 of the 12 term infants had cardiac malformations as well. \n\nSuperti-Furga et al. (1991) reported the maternal PKU syndrome in cousins, caused by mild unrecognized PKU in their mothers, who were homozygous for the arg261-to-gln mutation (612349.0006). \n\nUsha et al. (1992) found 3 children with PKU embryofetopathy among the offspring of a Bedouin woman who was not recognized to have PKU until the birth of the third affected child. She had an apparently normal phenotype except for pigment dilution of the hair, which was more lightly colored than expected for the family and ethnic norms. She was not mentally retarded. One of the affected offspring had died of congenital heart disease at the age of 4 months. \n\nFisch et al. (1993) suggested that surrogate motherhood should be recommended as alternative management of PKU in women who wish to have children, i.e., in vitro fertilization using the parental gametes, followed by implantation of the pre-embryo in a surrogate mother. \n\nLevy et al. (1996) compared MRI results of 5 children (age range: 8 months to 17 years) whose mothers had classic PKU and were not under metabolic control (plasma phenylalanine = 1,260 micromoles per liter) during at least the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy to MRI results of 2 sibs aged 9 and 11 years whose mother had classic PKU but whose plasma phenylalanine levels were generally below 360 micromoles per liter during both pregnancies. The MRI results showed a tendency for corpus callosum hypoplasia in those children whose mothers were not in metabolic control during their pregnancies. All children studied (even those with mothers in metabolic control) displayed some residual developmental/behavioral effects such as hyperactivity. \n\nRouse et al. (1997) reported a collaborative study of maternal PKU offspring. The cohort of offspring were examined for malformations, including congenital heart disease, craniofacial abnormalities, microcephaly, intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, other major and minor defects, and early abnormal urologic signs. The mothers were grouped according to their mean phenylalanine levels during critical gestational weeks and average for phenylalanine exposure throughout the pregnancy. The frequency of congenital abnormalities increased with increasing maternal phenylalanine levels. Significant relationships included average phenylalanine levels at weeks 0 to 8 with congenital heart disease (P = 0.001); average phenylalanine at weeks 8 to 12 with brain, fetal, and postnatal growth retardation, broad nasal bridge, and anteverted nares; and average phenylalanine exposure during the entire pregnancy with neurologic signs. Although 14% of infants had congenital heart disease, none of the congenital heart disease occurred at the lower range of the maternal phenylalanine levels. At the lowest levels of phenylalanine, there were 3 infants (6%) with microcephaly, 2 (4%) with postnatal growth, and none with intrauterine growth retardation, in contrast to 85%, 51%, and 26%, respectively, with phenylalanine levels in the highest range. These data supported the concept that women with PKU should begin a low phenylalanine diet to achieve phenylalanine levels of less than 360 micromole/liter prior to conception and maintain this throughout the pregnancy. \n\nWaisbren et al. (2000) studied 149 children of women with PKU and 33 children of women with mild hyperphenylalaninemia at 4 years of age. Children were stratified by the timing of maternal metabolic control at 0 to 10 weeks', 10 to 20 weeks', or after 20 weeks' gestation. Scores of a General Cognitive Index decreased as weeks to maternal metabolic control increased. Offspring of women who had metabolic control prior to pregnancy had a mean score of 99. Forty-seven percent of offspring whose mothers did not have metabolic control by 20 weeks' gestation had a General Cognitive Index score 2 standard deviations below the norm. Overall, 30% of children born to mothers with PKU had social and behavioral problems. \n\nRouse et al. (2000) studied a cohort of 354 women with PKU, followed up weekly with diet records, blood phenylalanine levels, and sonograms obtained at 18 to 20 and 32 weeks' gestation. At birth, 413 offspring were examined; they were followed up at 3 months, 6 months, and then annually. Bayley Mental Developmental Index and Psychomotor Developmental Index tests were given at 1 and 2 years. Congenital heart defects were found in 31 offspring; of these, 17 also had microcephaly. Mean phenylalanine levels at 4 to 8 weeks' gestation predicted congenital heart defects (P less than 0.0001). An infant with a congenital heart defect had a 3-fold risk of having microcephaly when the mother had higher phenylalanine levels. No direct relationship to the specific PAH mutation was found. None of the women whose offspring had congenital heart defects had blood phenylalanine levels in control during the first 8 weeks of gestation. Rouse et al. (2000) concluded that women with PKU need to be well controlled on a low phenylalanine diet before conception and throughout pregnancy. \n\nLevy et al. (2001) reported on 416 offspring from 412 maternal PKU pregnancies that produced live births and compared them to 100 offspring from 99 control pregnancies. Thirty-four of the 235 offspring (14%; 95% confidence interval, 10.2 to 19.6%) from pregnancies in maternal PKU patients with a basal phenylalanine level of greater than 900 micromolar and not in metabolic control (defined as phenylalanine level less than or equal to 600 micromolar) by the eighth gestational week had congenital heart disease compared with 1 control offspring with congenital heart disease. One of the children among 50 from mothers with non-PKU mild hyperphenylalaninemia also had congenital heart disease. Coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were overrepresented. \n",
				"Diagnosis": "Matalon et al. (1977) reported high levels of phenylalanine hydroxylase in placenta and suggested use of placental biopsy in prenatal diagnosis. \n\nWoo (1983) identified a DNA restriction polymorphism detected by a phenylalanine hydroxylase cDNA probe and tentatively demonstrated the feasibility of carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis, using the haplotypes defined by the DNA polymorphism.\n\nBy the use of RFLPs related to the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, Lidsky et al. (1985) achieved prenatal diagnosis of a PKU homozygote and a PKU heterozygote. Riess et al. (1987) described experience with prenatal diagnosis of PKU by RFLP analysis. They pointed out that in those cases in which the affected child had died but a phenotypically normal brother or sister is available for investigation, full genetic predictability could be obtained only if this child proved to be homozygously healthy in the phenylalanine-loading heterozygote test. \n\nDiLella et al. (1988) showed that the 2 mutant alleles of PAH common among Caucasians of northern European ancestry can be detected by direct analysis of genomic DNA after specific amplification of a DNA fragment by PCR. The results suggested that it is technically feasible to develop a program for carrier detection of the genetic trait in a population of individuals without a family history of PKU. \n\nRamus et al. (1992) used PCR amplification of the low levels of mRNA resulting from illegitimate transcription of the PAH gene in fibroblasts and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes to detect mutations in patients with PKU. \n\nTaking advantage of the 'illegitimate' transcription of the PAH gene in circulating lymphocytes, Abadie et al. (1993) succeeded in making the DNA diagnosis of phenylketonuria. Furthermore, they identified 3 novel mutations in 2 patients. \n\nKalaydjieva et al. (1991) identified 3 silent mutations in the PAH gene, in codons 232, 245, and 385, linked to specific RFLP haplotypes in several Caucasian populations. All 3 mutations created a new restriction site and were easily detected on PCR-amplified DNA. The combined analysis of these markers and 1 or 2 PKU mutations formed a simple panel of diagnostic tests with full informativeness in a large proportion of PKU families. \n\nForrest et al. (1991) used a modification of the chemical cleavage of mismatch (CCM) method to identify mutations in PAH in PKU. They stated that 'judicious choice of probes gives the CCM method the potential to detect close to 100% of single-base mutations.' \n",

				"Description": "PKD1, an autosomal dominant form of polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), has the cardinal manifestations of renal cysts, liver cysts, and intracranial aneurysm. Acute and chronic pain and nephrolithiasis are common complications. The most serious renal complication is end-stage renal disease, which occurs in approximately 50% of patients by the age of 60 years. The typical age of onset is in middle life, but the range is from infancy to 80 years (summary by Wu and Somlo, 2000). ",
				"History": "Chanmugam et al. (1971) reported a family that might suggest linkage of hereditary spherocytosis (see 182900) and polycystic kidney disease. A father and 3 children had both diseases. Three other children and 4 sibs of the father were thought to be free of both diseases. There is, however, no other suggestion of location of a spherocytosis locus on chromosome 16, or chromosome 4 (cf. 173910), where genes for adult polycystic kidney disease have been mapped. ",
				"Clinical Features": "Ward et al. (2002) briefly reviewed clinical features and classification of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). The disease presentation of ARPKD is highly variable. In infancy, the disease results in significantly enlarged echogenic polycystic kidneys, with pulmonary hypoplasia resulting from oligohydramnios as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Liver involvement is detectable in approximately 45% of infants and is often the major feature in older patients. The pathologic findings of collecting-duct ectasia in the kidney and ductal-plate malformation in the liver indicates that the basic defect of ARPKD may be a failure of terminal differentiation in the collecting-duct and biliary systems. The variable clinical presentation led to earlier separation into different clinicopathologic groups: perinatal, neonatal, infantile, and juvenile, depending on the age of presentation and the severity of renal and liver disease (Blyth and Ockenden, 1971), suggesting different genetic entities; see HISTORY. Subsequently, evidence of intrafamilial phenotypic variability (Kaplan et al., 1988; Deget et al., 1995) and genetic linkage studies (Zerres et al., 1994; Guay-Woodford et al., 1995) suggested that a less rigid subdivision is indicated, with allelic, rather than genetic, heterogeneity explaining much of the observed variability (Zerres et al., 1998). \n\nIt has long been recognized that the age distribution of cases of polycystic kidneys has 2 peaks, one at birth and one between ages 30 to 60 years. Furthermore, most cases with the later peak show the familial pattern of an autosomal dominant (173900). Kaariainen (1987) collected information in Finland on 82 children treated during the years 1974 to 1983 for polycystic kidney disease. The frequency was about 1 per 8,000 births. Early lethal disease was present in 51, whereas 31 survived for over 28 days. The children came from 69 families. They were divided by family studies into 3 groups: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in 11 families, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in 14, and sporadic cases in 44 families. In 3 of the 'dominant' families, 2 or more sibs had manifestations of PKD neonatally. The majority of the grandparents of the children with the recessive or the sporadic form were born in the same sparsely populated areas in northern, central, and eastern Finland, which suggested that most of the sporadic cases were actually recessive PKD. \n\nOne of the notable features of both dominant and recessive PKD in humans is the variability of the phenotype, with respect to both disease progression and extrarenal manifestations. While a significant component of this variance is probably due to genetic heterogeneity, Kaplan et al. (1989) documented marked variability of clinical disease even within kindreds. Kaplan et al. (1988) presented evidence contradicting the view that perinatal, neonatal, infantile, and juvenile forms of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease represent 4 discrete entities. They described an instructive family in which a male infant presented at birth with very large cystic kidneys together with portal fibrosis and ductule proliferation in the liver, bilateral pulmonary atelectasis, large atrial septal defect, and a ventricular septal defect. Death occurred at 18 hours. An older sib presented at the age of 16 years with no symptoms because the mother wanted reassurance that the daughter had no condition similar to that of the deceased sib. Blood pressure was normal. The liver and spleen were enlarged. Ultrasonography, radiologic studies, and liver biopsy showed renal tubular ectasia and congenital hepatic fibrosis. Thus, the perinatal and juvenile forms of Blyth and Ockenden (1971) are likely to be opposite ends of the phenotypic spectrum of a single entity. \n\nZerres et al. (1984) gave a comprehensive review of all types of cystic kidney. They stated that evidence of so-called congenital hepatic fibrosis is 'indispensable for the diagnosis of ARPKD.' Hartung and Guay-Woodford (2014) noted that although histologic biliary abnormalities are a universal feature of ARPKD, clinical expression varies widely. In various cohorts, the proportion of ARPKD patients with imaging findings of liver disease has ranged from 45 to 90%. \n\nGross cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree is usually called Caroli disease (congenital biliary ectasia, or nonobstructive intrahepatic bile duct dilatation; see 600643); its frequent association with ARPKD is well established (Bernstein et al., 1975). Caroli disease is a rare cause of chronic cholestasis and hepatolithiasis in young adults. Ros et al. (1993) reported results of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in 12 patients with Caroli disease and intrahepatic stones. The duodenal bile of these patients contained cholesterol crystals which suggested that the stones were cholesterol rich. UDCA led to sustained clinical remission, return to normal liver function, and dissolution of intrahepatic stones on ultrasound in all patients. Tsuchida et al. (1995) described Caroli disease in a brother and sister whose asymptomatic father was shown to have the same disease by CT scan. They suggested that the mode of inheritance in this family and in many other instances is autosomal dominant, not autosomal recessive. The sister had undergone laparotomy at the age of 5 years because of hepatomegaly and mottled radiopacities shown by cholangiography. With medical management she remained in good health for the next 21 years. Mottled radiopacities of the hepatic parenchyma were demonstrated by cholangiography in her 9-year-old brother at the time the diagnosis of Caroli disease was made in the sister. He remained asymptomatic, however, until hematemesis due to esophageal varices occurred 21 years later at the age of 30 years. While their healthy father was at that time shown to have the same disease by CT scan, the mother of the affected sibs had a completely normal intrahepatic biliary tree by intravenous cholangiography. Presumably, there was no cystic involvement of the kidneys in any of the 3 affected members of the family. If Caroli disease is defined simply as polycystic dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts with hepatic fibrosis, it is likely that not all cases have this disorder as part of either infantile or adult polycystic kidney disease. It is possible that some cases represent a distinct entity of isolated hepatic fibrosis with cysts and that some of these represent a distinct genetic entity in its own right (see 600643). However, Adeva et al. (2006) concluded that relatively isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis and/or Caroli disease are part of the ARPKD spectrum. \n\nDeget et al. (1995) observed 42 children from 20 sibships with ARPKD, pro- and retrospectively, over a mean period of 3.7 years. Using the subclassification of Blyth and Ockenden (1971), they assigned 12 patients to the perinatal, 9 to the neonatal, 13 to the infantile, and 8 to the juvenile category. In 11 of the 20 families, different subtypes were observed among affected sibs; in 7 families, affected sibs belonged to adjacent subgroups, while major intrafamilial differences were observed in 4 families. The phenotypic manifestations ranged from stillbirths to mildly affected adults, while intrafamilial variability of the clinical picture was generally small with multiple allelism as the most likely genetic explanation. Age at death showed gross variation in 8 sibships. Sex influence could not explain the differences in clinical course between sibs. \n\nBlickman et al. (1995) reported the sonographic changes in renal function seen on long-term follow-up of children who had the initial diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease made in the neonatal period. The evaluation involved 14 children with biopsy evidence of the disease; 9 children who survived the neonatal period were followed up for a mean of 13 years (range, 5-19 years) after diagnosis. They found that kidney size as seen on sonograms did not continue to increase despite the patients' linear growth and maintained normal renal function. Rather, a decrease in kidney size and change in echogenicity occurred, producing a pattern similar to that seen on sonograms of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease but without the marked increase in kidney size that occurs in that entity. The authors thought that the changing cystic pattern on follow-up sonograms may have been the reason that previous descriptions have varied and why a decrease in size may not herald deteriorating renal function. \n\nCoffman (2002) commented on the elucidation of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease by Ward et al. (2002). They published photographs of gross and microscopic views of a specimen from a patient with ARPKD showing the typical pattern of fusiform, cylindrical channels occupying most of the kidney parenchyma and representing massively dilated terminal branches of collecting ducts. A photomicrograph showed the radially oriented, fusiform cysts characteristic of ARPKD. \n\nBosch et al. (2003) described clinical and renal function stabilization in a 3-year-old Turkish female who survived neonatal onset without hepatic fibrosis, thereby illustrating that prognostication should be cautious even with severe neonatal presentation. \n\nGuay-Woodford and Desmond (2003) analyzed the largest single group of patients with ARPKD (The ARPKD Clinical Database) which was divided into a younger cohort of 166 patients born after January 1, 1990 (median age 5.4 years, 45.8% detected prenatally) and an older cohort of 43 patients born before 1990 biased for long-term survival (median age 14 years, 5.6% detected prenatally). They found a slower rate of disease progression in the older cohort, as assessed by age of ARPKD diagnosis, as well as age of diagnosis of clinical morbidities. Neonatal ventilation was strongly predictive of mortality as well as an earlier age of diagnosis in those who developed systemic hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency. However, for those who survived the perinatal period, the long-term prognosis for survival was much better than generally perceived; 1- and 5-year survival was approximately 90% for those who survived the first month of life. Portal hypertension was not correlated with age at diagnosis, and only a small subset of patients developed clinically significant periportal fibrosis. \n\nBergmann et al. (2005) examined the clinical course of 164 neonatal survivors out of 186 ARPKD patients from 126 unrelated families. The mean observation period was 6 years (range, 0-35 years), and the 1- and 10-year survival rates were 85% and 82%, respectively. Chronic renal failure was first detected at a mean age of 4 years, with actuarial renal survival rates of 86% at 5 years, 71% at 10 years, and 42% at 20 years. All but 6 patients (92%) had a kidney length on or above the 97th centile for age. About 75% of the study population developed systemic hypertension. Sequelae of congenital hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension developed in 44% of patients and were related to age. Positive correlations observed between renal and hepatobiliary-related morbidity suggested uniform disease progression rather than organ-specific patterns. Bergmann et al. (2005) noted that missense changes were more frequently observed among patients with a milder clinical course, whereas chain-terminating mutations were more commonly associated with a severe phenotype. \n\nAdeva et al. (2006) commented that the autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease had generally been considered an infantile disorder with typical presentation of greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys detected in utero or within the neonatal period, often resulting in neonatal demise; however, there was an increasing realization that survivors often thrived into adulthood with complications of ductal plate malformation, manifesting as congenital hepatic fibrosis and Caroli disease, becoming prominent. Adeva et al. (2006) retrospectively reviewed the clinical records, and where possible performed PKHD1 mutation screening, in patients diagnosed with ARPKD or congenital hepatic fibrosis at the Mayo Clinic in the period 1961 to 2004. Of 133 cases reviewed, 65 were considered to meet the diagnostic criteria, with an average duration of follow-up of 8.6 +/- 6.4 years. ARPKD was present in 55 cases and 10 had isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis with no or minimal renal involvement. The patients were analyzed in 3 groups categorized by the age at diagnosis: less than 1 year (22 patients), 1 to 20 years (23 patients), and more than 20 years (20 patients). The presenting feature in the neonates was typically associated with renal enlargement, but in the older groups more often involved manifestations of liver disease, including hepatosplenomegaly, hypersplenism, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis. During follow-up, 22 patients had renal insufficiency and 8 developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD), most from the neonatal group. Liver disease was evident on follow-up in all diagnostic groups but particularly prevalent in those diagnosed later in life. In all, 12 patients died, 6 in the neonatal period, but 86% of patients were alive at 40 years of age. The likelihood of being alive without ESRD differed significantly between the diagnostic groups with 36%, 80%, and 88% survival in the 3 groups, respectively, 20 years after the diagnosis. Considerable intrafamilial phenotypic variability was observed. Mutation analysis was performed in 31 families and at least 1 mutation was detected in 25 (81%), with 76% mutant alleles detected in those cases. Consistent with the relatively mild disease manifestations in this group of patients, most of the mutations were missense (79%) and no case had 2 truncating changes. Mutations were detected in all diagnostic groups, indicating that congenital hepatic fibrosis with minimal kidney involvement can result from PKHD1 mutation. No mutations were detected in 6 cases. \n",
				"Diagnosis": "Schmidt et al. (1982) reported a successful experience with prenatal diagnosis of kidney disease by ultrasonography in 23 families. \n\nZerres et al. (1998) noted that prenatal diagnosis of ARPKD using fetal sonography can be unreliable, especially in early pregnancy. They examined the feasibility and reliability of haplotype-based prenatal testing in pregnancies 'at risk' for ARPKD. In a 27-month period they received 258 inquiries regarding prenatal evaluation and completed analyses in 212 families. At the time of report, 65 prenatal analyses had been performed in 57 families. In 45 of the 57 requesting families, the index children were deceased and DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue. Homozygosity for the disease-associated haplotypes was found in 18 fetuses. In 12 of these fetuses, pathoanatomical examination demonstrated typical ARPKD changes consisting of dilated collecting ducts and the characteristic hepatic ductal plate malformation. In 2 fetuses, these changes were detected as early as 13 weeks of gestational age. Forty-three fetuses were either heterozygous or homozygous for a nondisease-associated haplotype and all those who were born were phenotypically unaffected at birth. In 4 cases, no genotypic prediction was possible because a recombination event occurred between the flanking markers. Three of these pregnancies were terminated and necropsy of the fetuses confirmed ARPKD; 1 fetus was carried to term and showed no abnormalities at birth. An absolute prerequisite for prenatal diagnosis by this method is an accurate diagnosis of ARPKD in previously affected sib(s). \n",

				"Description": "Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by diminished fetal activity, obesity, muscular hypotonia, mental retardation, short stature, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and small hands and feet. It can be considered to be an autosomal dominant disorder and is caused by deletion or disruption of a gene or several genes on the proximal long arm of the paternal chromosome 15 or maternal uniparental disomy 15, because the gene(s) on the maternal chromosome(s) 15 are virtually inactive through imprinting. Horsthemke and Wagstaff (2008) provided a detailed review of the mechanisms of imprinting of the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome (105830) region.",
				"History": "Langdon-Down (1828-1896), who described 'mongolism' (Down syndrome), also described PWS (Down, 1887) about 70 years before Prader et al. (1956), and called it polysarcia (see account by Brain, 1967). The patient was a mentally subnormal girl who, when 13 years old, was 4 feet 4 inches tall (1.32 m) and weighed 196 lbs (84 kg). At 25 years of age she weighed 210 lbs (95.4 kg). 'Her feet and hands remained small, and contrasted remarkably with the appendages they terminated. She had no hair in the axillae, and scarcely any on the pubis. She had never menstruated, nor did she exhibit the slightest sexual instinct.'",
				"Clinical Features": "The original paper by Prader et al. (1956) described the full clinical picture.\n\nPrenatal\n\nMothers with prior experience of normal pregnancies almost without exception report distinctly delayed onset and reduced fetal activity during the pregnancies involving Prader-Willi children. Obstetricians often fail to detect diminished fetal activity with ultrasound investigation. When reduced fetal activity is observed, prenatal cytogenetic examination produces normal results because cytogeneticists were not instructed to look for the characteristic chromosomal changes of PWS (Schinzel, 1986). Alert clinicians should refer CVS material from pregnancies with fetuses that demonstrate poor activity for molecular diagnosis of the syndrome (see below). Other candidates for prenatal diagnosis of PWS are fetuses of pregnancies in which trisomy 15 or mosaic trisomy 15 was determined from CVS, and in which subsequent amniocyte or fetal blood examinations disclosed a normal diploid karyotype. Theoretically, one-third of trisomy 15 fetuses initially with 2 maternal chromosomes 15 and 1 paternal chromosome 15 should give rise to Prader-Willi syndrome patients exhibiting maternal uniparental disomy (Cassidy et al., 1992; Purvis-Smith et al., 1992; Hall, 1992). \n\nPerinatal\n\nNeonates are profoundly hypotonic, which often causes asphyxia. In addition, there is mild prenatal growth retardation with a mean birth weight of about 6 lbs (2.8 kg) at term, hyporeflexia, poor feeding due to diminished swallowing and sucking reflexes, which in many cases necessitates gavage feeding for about 3 to 4 months. Cryptorchidism occurs with hypoplastic penis and scrotum in boys and hypoplastic labiae in girls (Stephenson, 1980). Chitayat et al. (1989) commented on the normal size of hands and feet at birth and in the first year of life. \n\nMiller et al. (1999) described 6 newborns evaluated for hypotonia who were later diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome. These newborns lacked the classic neonatal features of the syndrome (peculiar cry, characteristic craniofacial features, and clinical evidence of hypogonadism). The authors suggested that specific genetic testing for PWS be considered for all neonates with undiagnosed central hypotonia even in the absence of the other major features of the syndrome. \n\nOiglane-Shlik et al. (2006) studied 5 newborns with hypotonia, poor arousal, weak or absent cry, and no interest in food, in whom PWS was confirmed by the abnormal methylation test. All had a distinctive facial appearance, with high prominent forehead, narrow bifrontal diameter, downturned corners of the mouth, micrognathia, and dysplastic ears. Three neonates had a high-arched palate, and 4 had arachnodactyly. In the first few days of life, 4 of the 5 patients demonstrated a peculiar position of the hands, with the thumb constantly adducted over the index and middle finger. All 5 patients had transient bradycardia, thermolability, and acrocyanosis; and 3 also showed marked skin mottling, as previously reported by Chitayat et al. (1989). \n\nInfancy and Childhood\n\nFeeding difficulties generally improve by the age of 6 months. From 12 to 18 months onward, uncontrollable hyperphagia causes major somatic as well as psychologic problems. Diminished growth is observed in the majority of infants (Butler and Meaney, 1987). Small hands with delicate and tapering fingers and small feet (acromicria) are seen in most infants and adolescents; hand and foot sizes correlate well with length, but not with age, and foot size tends to be lower than hand size. However, patients of normal height tend to have normally sized hands (Hudgins and Cassidy, 1991). The face is characterized by a narrow bifrontal diameter, almond-shaped eyes (often in mild upslanted position), strabismus, full cheeks, and diminished mimic activity due to muscular hypotonia. Plethoric obesity becomes the most striking feature. From the age of about 6 years onward, many children present scars from scratching due to itching, and later, almost all show abdominal striae. \n\nDepigmentation relative to the familial background is a feature in about three-quarters of the patients. Butler (1989), Hittner et al. (1982), and several authors remarked that this sign is confined to cases with deletions and absent in those with maternal disomy 15. Phelan et al. (1988) presented a black female child with oculocutaneous albinism, PWS, and an interstitial deletion of 15q11.2. Patients with classic albinism (203100) have misrouting of optic fibers, with fibers from 20 degrees or more of the temporal retina crossing at the chiasm instead of projecting to the ipsilateral hemisphere. Misrouting can result in strabismus and nystagmus. Because patients with PWS have hypopigmentation and strabismus, Creel et al. (1986) studied 6 patients, selected for a history of strabismus, with pattern-onset visual evoked potentials on binocular and monocular stimulation. Of the 4 with hypopigmentation, 3 had abnormal evoked potentials indistinguishable from those recorded in albinos. The 2 with normal pigmentation had normal responses. Wiesner et al. (1987) found that 14 of 29 patients with PWS had ocular hypopigmentation. There was possible correlation between hypopigmentation and a deletion of 15q. \n\nMacMillan et al. (1972) described 2 unrelated girls with the features of PWS who additionally showed precocious puberty. They suggested that this is a variant and that a hypothalamic disturbance is responsible for this disorder. Hall and Smith (1972) pointed out narrow bifrontal cranial diameter as a feature. Hall (1985) pointed to a possibly increased risk of leukemia in PWS. \n\nA frequent feature generally overlooked is thick saliva at the edges of the mouth. Patients tend to be relatively insensitive to pain (including that caused by obtaining blood samples)(Prader, 1991).\n\nEiholzer et al. (1999) presented data on body composition and leptin (164160) levels of 13 young, still underweight children and 10 older overweight children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Both groups showed elevated skinfold standard deviation scores for body mass index and elevated body mass index-adjusted leptin levels, suggesting relatively increased body fat even in underweight children. Leptin production appeared to be intact. The authors concluded that body composition in PWS is already disturbed in infancy, long before the development of obesity. \n\nVan Mil et al. (2001) compared body composition in 17 patients with PWS with 17 obese control patients matched for gender and bone age. In children with PWS, adiposity was associated with reduced fat-free mass, and extracellular-to-intracellular water ratio was increased. Both findings are related to growth hormone (GH; 139250) function and physical activity. Bone mineral density, especially in the limbs, tends to be reduced in patients with PWS and is related to growth hormone function. \n\nGunay-Aygun et al. (2001) reviewed the sensitivity of PWS diagnostic criteria and proposed revised criteria for DNA testing. From birth to 2 years any infant with hypotonia and poor suck should have DNA testing for the PWS deletion. From age 2 to 6 years any child with hypotonia and a history of poor suck and global developmental delay should have DNA testing. From 6 years to 12 years any child with history of hypotonia and poor suck, global developmental delay, and excessive eating with central obesity should be tested for PWS. \n\nAdolescence and Adulthood\n\nGreenswag (1987) reported on a survey of 232 adults with PWS, ranging in age from 16 to 64 years. Of 106 patients whose chromosomes were analyzed, 54 had an abnormality of chromosome 15, primarily a deletion. Physical characteristics, health problems, intelligence, psychosocial adjustment, and impact on the family were reviewed. Emotional lability, poor gross motor skills, cognitive impairment, and insatiable hunger were especially remarkable features. \n\nOlander et al. (2000) pointed to the occurrence of 3 PWS phenotypes: patients with paternal deletions have the typical PWS phenotype; patients with maternal UPD have a slightly milder phenotype with better cognitive function; and patients with maternal UPD and mosaic trisomy 15 have the most severe phenotype with a high incidence of congenital heart disease. They described a patient with the severe phenotype with maternal isodisomy rather than the more common maternal heterodisomy. They concluded that the more severe PWS phenotype was due to trisomy 15 mosaicism rather than to homozygosity for deleterious chromosome 15 genes. \n\nIn contrast to infants, adults invariably are small compared to their family members (Butler and Meaney, 1987). Due to high caloric intake, alimentary diabetes frequently sets in during or soon after the period of puberty. Puberty itself is diminished in PWS patients of both sexes. Adolescents and young adults often require digitalization because of cardiac insufficiency; however, it has been shown that substantial weight reduction relieves the need of cardiac therapy. Any attempt to reduce food intake in these adolescents often leads to serious psychologic and behavioral problems, and in some children, the situation in their home environment becomes intolerable (Curfs et al., 1991). Patients rarely survive beyond 25 to 30 years of age, the cause of death being diabetes and cardiac failure. However, if strict weight control is achieved, both diabetes and cardiac failure are greatly reduced and survival is either not or only mildly reduced. Johnsen et al. (1967) studied 7 mentally retarded patients, aged 4 to 19 years. Studies showed that fat synthesis from acetate during fasting was 10 times greater in patients than in unaffected sibs, and that hormone-stimulated lipolysis was depressed. These workers suggested that the condition is comparable to the genetic obese-hyperglycemic mouse. Since during fasting substrate continues to be used for new fat and lipolysis is deficient, survival depends on a continuous supply of exogenous calories. The abundant fat, muscle hypotonia, and small feet and hands are exactly the opposite of the sparse fat, muscle hypertrophy, and large hands and feet in Seip syndrome (269700). \n\nHoybye et al. (2002) studied the clinical, genetic, endocrinologic, and metabolic findings in 10 male and 9 female adult PWS patients (mean age, 25 years). The PWS karyotype was demonstrated in 13 patients. The mean BMI was 35.6 kg/m2, and total body fat was increased. Two-thirds were biochemically hypogonadal. Fifty percent had severe GH deficiency. Four were hypertensive. One patient had heart failure and diabetes. Impaired glucose tolerance was seen in 4 patients, elevated homeostasis model assessment index in 9, and modest dyslipidemia in 7. IGF-binding protein-1 (146730) correlated negatively with insulin (176730) levels. Four patients had osteoporosis, and 11 had osteopenia. There was no significant difference between the group with the PWS karyotype and the group without the karyotype in age, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, percent body fat, insulin values, homeostasis model assessment index, or lipid profile, except for lipoprotein(a) (152200), which was significantly higher in the group with the negative karyotype. Hoybye et al. (2002) concluded that the risk factors found predicting cardiovascular disease were secondary to GHD and emphasized the importance of evaluating treatment of GHD in adults with PWS. \n\nCurfs et al. (1991) concluded that PWS patients score better on visual motor discrimination skills than on auditory verbal processing skills. \n\nWise et al. (1991) described 5 patients with PWS who experienced recurrent hyperthermia in infancy. On the basis of these patients and other reports of abnormal temperature regulation in PWS patients, particularly hypothermia with exposure to cold, they concluded that defects in temperature regulation may be a manifestation of hypothalamic dysfunction in PWS. On the other hand, Cassidy and McKillop (1991) concluded on the basis of a survey that clinically significant abnormal temperature control is not a common finding in this disorder. Similarly, Williams et al. (1994) concluded on the basis of a survey that the prevalence of febrile convulsions, fever-associated symptoms, and temperature less than 94 degrees F were not unique to PWS but can occur in any neurodevelopmentally handicapped individual and do not necessarily reflect syndrome-specific hypothalamic abnormalities. \n\nIndividuals with Prader-Willi syndrome manifest severe skin picking behavior. Bhargava et al. (1996) described 3 adolescent patients in whom an extension of this behavior to rectal picking resulted in significant lower gastrointestinal bleeding and anal rectal disease. Recognition of this behavior is important to avoid misdiagnosing inflammatory bowel disease in PWS patients. \n\nWharton et al. (1997) presented 6 patients with PWS with dramatic acute gastric distention. In 3 young adult women with vomiting and apparent gastroenteritis, clinical course progressed rapidly to massive gastric dilatation and gastric necrosis. One patient died of overwhelming sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In 2 children, gastric dilatation resolved spontaneously. Gastrectomy was performed in 2 cases; in 1, gastrectomy was subtotal and distal, whereas in the other, gastrectomy was combined with partial duodenectomy and pancreatectomy. All specimens showed ischemic gastroenteritis. There was diffuse mucosal infarction with multifocal transmural necrosis. \n\nFrom a study of 10 African Americans with PWS, Hudgins et al. (1998) pointed out that the clinical features differ from those of white patients. Growth is less affected, hand and foot lengths usually are normal, and the facies are atypical; as a result, PWS may be underdiagnosed in this population. \n\nLindgren et al. (2000) studied the microstructure of eating behavior in patients with PWS and compared it with that of members of obese and normal weight control groups of the same age. PWS patients had a mean age of 10 +/- 4 years, while the control groups were 12 +/- 3 years (normal weight) and 12 +/- 4 years (obese). Subjects with PWS had a longer duration of eating rate compared with members of both obese and normal weight groups. In subjects with PWS, 56% of the eating curves were non-decelerating, compared with 10% of the normal weight group and 30% of the obese group. Lindgren et al. (2000) concluded that the eating behavior found in subjects with PWS might be due to decreased satiation rather than increased hunger. \n\nNagai et al. (2000) reported standard growth curves for height and weight among Japanese children with Prader-Willi syndrome. No difference in height was seen between those with and those without chromosome 15q deletion. \n\nCassidy et al. (1997) personally examined and studied using molecular techniques 54 individuals with PWS to determine whether there are phenotypic differences between patients with the syndrome due to deletion (present in 37) or uniparental disomy (present in 17) as the mechanism. Previously recognized increased maternal age in patients with UPD and increased frequency of hypopigmentation in those with deletion were confirmed. Although the frequency and severity of most other manifestations of PWS did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, those with UPD were less likely to have a 'typical' facial appearance. In addition, this group was less likely to show some of the minor manifestations such as skin picking, skill with jigsaw puzzles, and high pain threshold. Females and those with UPD were also older, on average. \n\nGunay-Aygun et al. (2001) proposed new revised criteria for DNA testing for individuals in adolescence and adulthood. Anyone with cognitive impairment (usually mild mental retardation), excessive eating with central obesity, and hypothalamic hypogonadism, and/or typical behaviors, including temper tantrums and obsessive-compulsive features, should be referred for DNA testing for PWS. \n\nAmong 25 patients with PWS aged 18 years or older, Boer et al. (2002) found that 7 (28%) had severe affective disorder with psychotic features, with a mean age of onset of 26 years. The 7 affected persons, all aged 28 years or older, included all 5 with disomies of chromosome 15, 1 with a deletion in this chromosome, and 1 with an imprinting center mutation in the same chromosome. They postulated that in PWS, an abnormal pattern of expression of a sex-specific imprinted gene on chromosome 15 is associated with psychotic illness in early adult life. \n\nVogels et al. (2004) detailed the psychopathologic manifestations of 6 adults with PWS and a history of psychotic episodes. Characteristics of the psychotic disorder included early and acute onset, polymorphous and shifting symptoms, psychiatric hospitalization along with precipitating stress factors, and a prodromal phase of physiologic symptoms. \n\nTo evaluate the risk of cancer in patients with PWS, Davies et al. (2003) conducted a retrospective questionnaire survey of its occurrence among patients registered with the PWS Association compared with cases in the general US population based on the SEER program. The median age of 1,024 PWS patients was 19.0 years (range, 0.1-63 years) with 2 older than age 50. The ratio of observed (8) to expected (4.8) cancers was 1.67 (p = 0.1610; 95% CI = 0.72-3.28). Three myeloid leukemias were confirmed, resulting in a ratio of observed to expected of 40.18 (p = 0.0001; 95% CI = 8.0-117). The authors speculated that a gene within the 15q11-q13 region may be involved in the biology of myeloid leukemia or that secondary manifestations of PWS, such as obesity, may be associated with an increased risk of certain cancers. \n\nWey et al. (2005) described a woman with features consistent with PWS due to a mosaic imprinting defect. Three independent assays revealed a reduced proportion of nonmethylated SNURF-SNRPN alleles in peripheral blood DNA. Microsatellite analysis and FISH revealed apparently normal chromosomes 15 of biparental origin. Wey et al. (2005) estimated that approximately 50% of the patient's blood cells had an imprinting defect. Apart from a rather normal facial appearance, the proband had typical features of PWS in terms of truncal obesity, small hands with tapered fingers, and small feet. Operation for strabismus had been performed. When evaluated at 21 years of age, she presented with the major signs of PWS, except for the relatively normal facial appearance. Wey et al. (2005) suggested that the patient, although presenting with atypical PWS features at birth and in infancy, had progressively acquired more pronounced PWS features during childhood and adolescence. \n\nSinnema et al. (2012) reported the clinical features of 12 patients over the age of 50 years with genetically confirmed PWS. Eleven patients lived in a facility, and 1 lived with his elderly mother. Half of the patients had diabetes mellitus with an average age at diagnosis of 41.6 years. Three patients had hypertension, 3 had a history of stroke, 6 had a history of fractures, 10 had foot problems, 5 had scoliosis, 9 had edema, and 6 had erysipelas. Older patients had significantly lower functioning, particularly in activities of daily living, compared to younger control patients, and the decline began around age 40. All 8 patients with maternal uniparental disomy used psychotropic medications, 7 of whom had a psychiatric disorder. None of the 4 patients with a paternal deletion had a psychiatric illness. Sinnema et al. (2012) suggested that age-associated medical problems may be exacerbated by temperature instability, decreased mobility, and high pain threshold in PWS. Overall, the constellation of features suggested premature aging in PWS, which may also result from abnormalities in sex hormone levels. Sinnema et al. (2012) noted that the life expectancy of individuals with PWS had increased in recent years, and that these individuals have specific medical and social needs as they age. \n\nTo examine survival trends and risk factors in PWS, Manzardo et al. (2018) performed a survival analysis of the Prader-Willi Syndrome Association's 40-year mortality syndrome-specific database of 486 deaths. They compared 331 deaths that occurred between the years 2000 and 2015 (Recent) with 94 deaths that occurred before 2000 (Early). The risk for all-cause mortality in PWS was 1.5 (95% CI = 1.2-1.9) times higher for the Early than for the Recent cohort, reflected in female cardiac failure (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.3-2.6), pulmonary embolism (HR = 6.1; 95% CI = 1.7-22), and gastrointestinal-related (HR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.1-7.4) causes. Accidental deaths in males increased in the Recent cohort (HR = 5.7; 95% CI = 1.2-27.1), possibly due to enhanced weight management and mobility. Risk of death from respiratory failure was unchanged. \n\nButler et al. (2017) reviewed causes of death in Prader-Willi syndrome using the US Prader-Willi Syndrome Association 40-year mortality survey ranging from 1973 to 2015. A total of 486 deaths were reported (263 males, 217 females, 6 unknown) between 1973 and 2015, with mean age of 29.5 +/- 16 years (2 months-67 years); 70% occurred in adulthood. Respiratory failure was the most common cause, accounting for 31% of all deaths. Males were at increased risk for presumed hyperphagia-related accidents/injuries and cardiopulmonary factors compared to females. PWS maternal disomy 15 genetic subtype showed an increased risk of death from cardiopulmonary factors compared to the deletion subtype. \n\nPrader-Willi-like Syndrome Associated with Chromosome 6\n\nFryns et al. (1986) described an 8-month-old girl with a de novo 5q/6q autosomal translocation resulting in loss of the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q23.3-qter). Clinical manifestations included abnormal facies with broad, flat nasal bridge, small nose with broad tip, bilateral epicanthus, narrow palpebral fissures, small anteverted ears, and small mouth. Other features included truncal obesity, short hands and feet, and delayed psychomotor development. Prader-Willi syndrome was suspected initially. \n\nVilla et al. (1995) reported a 23-month-old boy with mental and psychomotor delay, minor craniofacial abnormalities, and obesity who had a de novo interstitial deletion of chromosome 6q16.2-q21. The authors noted the phenotypic similarities to Prader-Willi syndrome. In a boy with clinical features mimicking Prader-Willi syndrome, but with a normal chromosome 15, Stein et al. (1996) found a de novo interstitial deletion of 6q22.2-q23.1. The boy showed delayed development, hypotonia, seizures, hyperactive behavior, a bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis, small hands and feet, hypogonadism, and obesity since about 4 years of age. In a 38-year-old man with moderate to severe intellectual delay, short stature, small hands and feet, small mouth, and obesity, Smith et al. (1999) found a duplication of 6q24.3-q27. The authors noted that the phenotype showed similarities to Prader-Willi syndrome. \n\nAs reviewed by Gilhuis et al. (2000), several obese patients with cytogenetic alterations in the same region of 6q had been reported; all had in common some clinical features, including obesity, hypotonia, and developmental delays, resembling Prader-Willi syndrome. However, their behavior, facial features, and additional neurologic abnormalities, as well as a lack of cytogenetic changes or imprinting mutations on chromosome 15, clearly distinguished this PWS-like phenotype from PWS patients. \n\nHolder et al. (2000) studied a girl with early-onset obesity and a balanced translocation between 1p22.1 and 6q16.2. At 67 months of age she weighed 47.5 kg (+9.3 SD) and was 127.2 cm tall (+3.2 SD); her weight for height was +6.3 SD. The child displayed an aggressive, voracious appetite, and the obesity was thought to be due to high intake, since measured energy expenditure was normal. However, the authors noted that apart from her obesity, there were no features suggestive of PWS. Genetic analysis of the region on chromosome 6 showed that the translocation disrupted the SIM1 gene (603128). Holder et al. (2000) hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of the SIM1 gene may be responsible for the obesity. In a boy with a Prader-Willi-like phenotype, Faivre et al. (2002) identified a deletion of chromosome 6q16.1-q21. Intrauterine growth retardation, oligohydramnios, and a left clubfoot were noted during the third trimester of pregnancy. Later, generalized obesity, slightly dysmorphic facial features, small hands and feet, clumsiness, and mental retardation were observed. Molecular analysis showed that the deletion was paternal in origin and resulted in a deletion of the SIM1 gene. \n\n\n▼ Other Features\nMiller et al. (2007) evaluated 3-dimensional brain MRI scans of 20 individuals with PWS aged 3 months to 39 years. Intracranial morphologic abnormalities included ventriculomegaly (100%), decreased volume of the parietal-occipital lobe (50%), sylvian fissure polymicrogyria (60%), and incomplete insular closure (65%). \n\nFan et al. (2009) found that 10 of 56 PWS patients had seizures, 9 of whom had generalized seizures attributable to PWS. The remaining patient was born with intraventricular hemorrhage and had focal epileptic discharges, which was thought to be responsible for the seizures. Eight of the 9 with PWS-related seizures had a 15q11-q13 deletion, suggesting that decreased inhibitory effects of the GABA receptor cluster in this region may play a role in epileptogenesis. Six additional patients of the 56 had paroxysmal events such as staring spells, tremor spells, and collapsing spells. \n",
				"Diagnosis": "proposed 2 scoring systems as diagnostic criteria: one for children aged 0-36 months and another for children aged 3 years to adults (Holm et al., 1993). \n\nThe American Society of Human Genetics/American College of Medical Genetics Test and Technology Transfer Committee (1996) outlined approaches to the laboratory diagnosis of PWS and Angelman syndrome. \n\nWhite et al. (1996) exploited the allele-specific replication differences that had been observed in imprinted chromosomal regions to obtain a diagnostic test for detecting uniparental disomy. They used FISH of D15S9 and SNRPN (182279) on interphase nuclei to distinguish between Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome patient samples with uniparental disomy of 15q11-q13 and those with biparental inheritance. They found that the familial recurrence risks are low when the child has de novo uniparental disomy and may be as high as 50% when the child has biparental inheritance. The frequency of interphase cells with asynchronous replication was significantly lower in patients with uniparental disomy than in patients with biparental inheritance. Within the sample population of patients with biparental inheritance, those with altered methylation and presumably imprinting center mutations could not be distinguished from those with no currently detectable mutation. White et al. (1996) considered the test cost-effective because it could be performed on interphase cells from the same hybridized cytologic preparation in which a deletion was included, and additional specimens were not required to determine the parental origin of chromosome 15. \n\nKubota et al. (1996) noted that neither FISH nor uniparental disomy (UPD) analysis with microsatellite markers will detect rare PWS patients with imprinting mutations, including small deletions or point mutations in the imprinting center region. They reported that as an initial screening test, methylation analysis has the advantage of detecting all of the major classes of molecular defects involved in PWS (deletions, uniparental disomy, and imprinting mutations) without the need for parental blood. Kubota et al. (1996) reported that in 67 patients examined clinically, the methylation results for PW71 were consistent with the clinical diagnosis. They concluded that SNRPN methylation analysis, similar to PW71 methylation analysis, constitutes a reliable diagnostic test for PWS. They emphasized the importance of conventional cytogenetic analysis in parallel with DNA methylation analysis. They noted that a few patients with signs of PWS have balanced translocations within or distal to SNRPN and normal methylation patterns. They noted also that conventional cytogenetic analysis is important to rule out other cytogenetic anomalies in patients who may have similar clinical manifestations but who do not have PWS. \n\nSince the SNRPN gene is not expressed in any patient with PWS regardless of the underlying cytogenetic or molecular cause, Wevrick and Francke (1996) tested for expression of the SNRPN gene and a control gene in 9 patients with PWS and 40 control individuals by PCR analysis of reverse transcribed mRNA from blood leukocytes. SNRPN expression could readily be detected in blood leukocytes by PCR analysis in all control samples but not in samples from known PWS patients. Four suspected PWS cases were negative for SNRPN expression and were found to have chromosome 15 rearrangements, while the diagnosis of PWS was excluded in 7 other patients with normal SNRPN expression based on clinical, molecular, and cytogenetic findings. Thus, Wevrick and Francke (1996) concluded that the SNRPN-expression test is rapid and reliable in the molecular diagnosis of PWS. \n\nThe diagnostic criteria arrived at by a consensus group (Holm et al., 1993) were presented in a table by Schulze et al. (1996). In a point system, 1 point each was allowed for each of 5 major criteria, such as feeding problems in infancy and failure to thrive, and one-half point each for 7 minor criteria, such as hypopigmentation. A minimum of 8.5 points was considered necessary for the diagnosis of PWS. \n\nHordijk et al. (1999) reported a boy with a PWS-like phenotype who was found to have maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14. The authors noted that while previous reports of this phenotype had been associated with a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14, in this case the karyotype was normal. Hordijk et al. (1999) concluded that patients with a PWS-like phenotype and normal results of DNA analysis for PWS should be reexamined for uniparental disomy for maternal chromosome 14. \n\nWhittington et al. (2002) compared clinical and genetic laboratory diagnoses of PWS. The genetic diagnosis was established using the standard investigation of DNA methylation of SNRPN, supplemented with cytogenetic studies. The 5 clinical features of floppy at birth, weak cry or inactivity, poor suck, feeding difficulties, and hypogonadism were present in 100% of persons with positive genetic findings, the absence of any 1 predicting a negative genetic finding. The combination of poor suck at birth, weak cry or inactivity, decreased vomiting, and thick saliva correctly classified 92% of all cases. Whittington et al. (2002) hypothesized that these criteria ('core criteria') invariably present when genetic findings are positive and are necessary accompaniments of the genetics of PWS. No subset of clinical and behavioral criteria was sufficient to predict with certainty a positive genetic diagnosis, but the absence of any 1 of the core criteria predicted a negative genetic finding. \n",
				"Cytogenetics": "Deletions account for 70 to 80% of cases; the majority are interstitial deletions, many of which can be visualized by prometaphase banding examination. A minority consist of unbalanced translocations, mostly de novo, which are easily detected by routine chromosome examination. The remainder of cases are the result of maternal uniparental disomy. In most of these latter cases, cytogenetic examinations yield normal results. However, in a few cases, either balanced translocations, familial or de novo, or supernumerary small marker chromosomes, are observed.\n\nDeletions\n\nButler et al. (1986) found an interstitial deletion of chromosome 15 (breakpoints q11 and q13) in 21 of 39 cases and an apparently normal karyotype in the remainder. By studying chromosome 15 heteromorphisms, the del(15q) was demonstrably paternal in origin in all cases, although both parents were normal and all deletions were de novo events. Paternal age was not increased. The exclusively paternal origin of deletions was subsequently confirmed cytogenetically and by molecular marker analysis (Magenis et al., 1990; Zori et al., 1990; Robinson et al., 1991). Examination of other series of patients by different groups resulted in the figures that two-thirds to three-fourths of PWS patients have a deletion of 15q11-q13. In less than 10%, this is due to an unbalanced translocation while the remainder have interstitial deletions. \n\nTo analyze the mechanism underlying the interstitial de novo deletions at 15q11-q13 that underlie approximately 70% of PWS cases, Carrozzo et al. (1997) genotyped 10 3-generation families of PWS-deletion patients using microsatellite markers flanking the common deletion region. By FISH and/or other molecular techniques, each patient was known to be deleted for the interval from D15S11 to GABRB3. In 5 of 7 cases, a different grandparental origin was identified for the alleles flanking the deletion, a finding significantly different from the expected frequency in light of the close position of the markers. This finding was considered highly suggestive of an unequal crossover occurring in the paternal meiosis at the breakpoint as the mechanism leading to deletion. The authors noted that asymmetric exchanges between nonsister chromatids in meiosis I have previously been demonstrated and are the basis of a number of genetic diseases. When the related sequences are part of tandemly arrayed homologous genes, nonhomologous recombination may lead to the formation of chimeric genes, such as those of Lapore hemoglobin and of the red-green pigment genes involved in abnormalities of color vision. In other instances, the deletion/duplication event may arise from the unequal recombination between repetitive elements interspersed throughout a genomic region. A misalignment between Alu-repetitive sequences has been demonstrated in duplications of the LDL-receptor gene (606945; Lehrman et al., 1987) and the HPRT gene (308000; Marcus et al., 1993). \n\nIn 2 PWS families studied by Carrozzo et al. (1997), the data were consistent with an intrachromosomal mechanism being responsible for the deletion. One of the few precedents for intrachromosomal recombination leading to human disease is provided by the recombination that occurs between the small intronless gene within intron 22 of the factor VIII gene (300841), and a copy of gene A (FSA; 305423) located 500 kb telomeric to the F8 gene, a recombination that causes severe hemophilia (306700) (Lakich et al., 1993). This rearrangement arises almost exclusively in male meioses, indicating that it is intrachromosomal. Carrozzo et al. (1997) suggested that the in-cis mechanism leading to the deletions in PWS patients may be related either to an exchange of chromosomal material between sister chromatids or to the formation of an intrachromosomal loop, either during meiosis or as a somatic event, followed by an excision of the chromosomal material lying between the recombining regions. \n\nDeletions in PWS and AS are subdivided into 2 main groups based on their proximal breakpoints: type 1 deletions encompass the region between BP1 and BP3 (about 6 Mb) and type 2 deletions encompass the region from BP2 to BP3 (about 5.3 Mb). However, some patients have atypical deletions. Using methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to analyze the type of deletion in 88 PWS patients, Kim et al. (2012) found that 32 (36.4%) had a type 1 deletion and 49 (55.7%) had a type 2 deletion. Seven patients (8%) had atypical larger (2) or smaller (5) de novo deletions that were associated with unique phenotypic features, although there were no unifying characteristics across the group. Variable atypical clinical features in these patients included macrocephaly, microcephaly, large hands, no hypopigmentation, lack of facial gestalt, and variable cognitive impairment. Kim et al. (2012) discussed the possible role of different genes in the manifestation of different features. \n\nIn a 23-year-old woman with Prader-Willi syndrome, Bieth et al. (2015) identified a paternally transmitted 118-kb deletion of the SNORD116 gene cluster. The authors stated that this was the smallest deletion described to that time. SNORD109A and IPW (601491) were also deleted in the patient. SNORD116 expression was absent in patient cells, but present in her unaffected father's cells. \n\nMaternal Uniparental Disomy\n\nNicholls et al. (1989), studying cases of PWS in which no deletion was cytologically evident using RFLP analysis, were the first to demonstrate maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) in 2 families. Two different, apparently intact, maternal chromosomes were present ('heterodisomy'), and, as with deletion cases of PWS, there was an absence of paternal genes from the 15q11-q13 segment. Robinson et al. (1991) used cytogenetic and molecular techniques to examine 37 patients with features of PWS. Clinical features in 28 of the patients were thought to fulfill diagnostic criteria for typical PWS. In 21 of these, a deletion of the 15q11.2-q12 region could be identified molecularly, including several cases in which the cytogenetic results were inconclusive. Five cases of maternal heterodisomy and 2 of isodisomy for 15q11-q13 were observed. All 9 patients who did not fulfill clinical criteria for typical PWS showed normal maternal and paternal inheritance of chromosome 15 markers; however, one of these carried a ring-15 chromosome. Thus, all typical PWS cases showed either a deletion or maternal uniparental disomy of 15q11.2-q12. As the disomy patients did not show any additional or more severe features than did the typical deletion patients, it is likely that there is only one imprinted region on chromosome 15. A significantly increased mean maternal age was found in the disomy cases, suggesting an association between increased maternal age and nondisjunction. \n\nMascari et al. (1992) demonstrated maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15 in 18 of 30 patients (60%) without a cytogenetic deletion. Furthermore, they confirmed the observation of Robinson et al. (1991) that the phenomenon was associated with advanced maternal age. In another 8 patients (27%), they identified large molecular deletions. The remaining 4 patients (13%) had evidence of normal biparental inheritance for chromosome 15; 3 of these patients were the only ones in the study which had some atypical clinical features. All told, they estimated that about 20% of cases of PWS result from maternal uniparental disomy and that, by the combined use of cytogenetic and molecular techniques, the genetic basis of PWS can be identified in at least 95% of patients. \n\nMitchell et al. (1996) compared 79 cases of PWS with UPD and 43 cases with deletions. Although there were no major clinical differences between the 2 classes of patients analyzed as a whole, mean maternal and paternal age were significantly higher in the UPD patients. The UPD group had a predominance of males, yet a gender bias was not seen in the deletion group. Hypopigmentation was found in 77% of the deletion group compared to only 39% of the UPD children. When the groups were analyzed by gender, females with UPD tended to be less severely affected than female deletion patients. \n\nMutirangura et al. (1993) demonstrated maternal heterodisomy in 10 PWS patients. Since the markers used were 13 cM from the centromere, heterodisomy indicated that maternal meiosis I nondisjunction was primarily involved in the origin of UPD. In contrast, 2 paternal disomy cases of Angelman syndrome (AS) showed isodisomy for all markers tested along the length of chromosome 15. This suggested a paternal meiosis II nondisjunction event (without crossing over) or, more likely, monosomic conception (due to maternal nondisjunction) followed by chromosome duplication. The latter mechanism would indicate that at least some instances of uniparental disomy in PWS and AS initiate as reciprocal products of maternal nondisjunction events. \n\nRobinson et al. (1993) reported data indicating that the majority (82%) of maternal nondisjunction events leading to UPD and causing PWS involve a meiosis I error, whereas most paternal UPD Angelman syndrome cases are meiosis II or, more likely, mitotic errors. Robinson et al. (1993) made the interesting statement that the proportion of UPD cases among all PWS patients in Switzerland is higher than in the United States, which could reflect the higher mean maternal age at birth in Switzerland versus the United States. \n\nGold et al. (2014) studied the frequency of Prader-Willi syndrome in births conceived via assisted reproductive technology (ART). The overall incidence in those who used ART was 1.1%; the population frequency for the United States was 1.0%. However, the proportion of individuals with maternal disomy 15/imprinting defects born after ART was higher than that in the total sample, 55.6% (10 of 18) and 34.5% (431 of 1,250), respectively. As compared with naturally conceived individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome, those who were ART-conceived were more likely to have uniparental disomy and imprinting defects than deletions. This study also demonstrated no association between twinning and Prader-Willi syndrome when ART-conceived pregnancies were excluded. ",
				"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations": "La Spada et al. (1991) observed a correlation between CAG length and disease severity. In an analysis of 26 Japanese SBMA patients from 21 families, Doyu et al. (1992) found the same results: the greater the number of CAG repeats, the lower the age of onset of limb muscular weakness and the higher the age-adjusted disability score. La Spada et al. (1992) concluded that although there was a correlation between disease severity and CAG repeat length, other factors seemed to contribute to the phenotypic variability. They found that expanded (CAG)n alleles underwent alteration in length when transmitted from parent to offspring. Of 45 meioses examined, 12 (27%) demonstrated a change in CAG repeat number. Both expansions and contractions were observed, although their magnitude was small. There was a greater rate of instability in male meiosis than in female meiosis. \n\nThe findings of Amato et al. (1993) in 17 patients from 7 families appeared to be at variance with the findings of others: no large expansion of the mutation was observed in transmission through 3 generations of 1 family, and phenotypic expression, although variable between and within families, was not related to the size of the mutation. The authors stated that anticipation had not clearly been observed in Kennedy disease. "

				"Description": "Spinal muscular atrophy refers to a group of autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorders characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, leading to symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy (summary by Wirth, 2000).\n\nFour types of SMA are recognized depending on the age of onset, the maximum muscular activity achieved, and survivorship: type I, severe infantile acute SMA, or Werdnig-Hoffman disease; type II (253550), or infantile chronic SMA; type III (253400), juvenile SMA, or Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander disease; and type IV (271150), or adult-onset SMA. All types are caused by recessive mutations in the SMN1 gene.",
				"History": "Becker (1964) suggested an allelic model for the clinically distinct subtypes of SMA: 3 or more normal alleles (a, a', a'') in addition to the pathologic gene a(+). The genotype a'a(+) was thought to lead to Kugelberg-Welander phenotype and the a''a(+) genotype to the Werdnig-Hoffmann phenotype. Bouwsma and Leschot (1986) extended the allele hypothesis of Becker. They presented clinical and genetic findings in 18 patients from 7 pedigrees showing an unusual genetic pattern not consistent with simple autosomal recessive inheritance. In 6 of the 7 pedigrees, different types of SMA were present. However, Muller et al. (1992) presented evidence rejecting the Becker hypothesis. In a sample of 4 sibships in which both SMA type II and SMA type III occurred, the segregation of linked markers indicated that the same allele was involved. The finding suggested that other factors, genetic or environmental, must determine disease severity in SMA.\n\nKleyn et al. (1991) excluded both the HEXB locus (606873) and the GM2-activator protein locus (GM2A; 613109), both of which are located on chromosome 5, as the site of the mutation in SMA. Recombination between HEXB and SMA eliminated this enzyme as a candidate site. Furthermore, the gene encoding the activator protein was found to map distal to the SMA I locus (Heng et al., 1993).",
				"Clinical Features": "Kennedy et al. (1968) described spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy in 9 males from 2 unrelated kindreds. Patients had onset of fasciculations followed by muscle weakness and wasting at approximately 40 years of age. Characteristic features included bulbar signs, facial fasciculations, and dysphagia. Three patients had gynecomastia. Pyramidal, sensory, and cerebellar signs were absent, suggesting lower motor neuron involvement. The disorder was compatible with a long life. Early reports of Japanese families may have referred to the same disorder (Takikawa, 1953; Murakami, 1957; Kurland, 1957; Tsukagoshi et al., 1965). \n\nQuarfordt et al. (1970) described 4 brothers with adult-onset proximal spinal muscular atrophy. Type II hyperlipoproteinemia was present in all 4 and was absent from their 1 unaffected sib, a sister. Some children of affected males, too young to show the neurologic abnormality, also showed hyperlipoproteinemia. \n\nSchoenen et al. (1979) listed the clinical hallmarks of Kennedy disease as onset in the third decade, slow progression, involvement of facial and bulbar muscles, and wasting of the proximal and, in some cases, the distal musculature. Clinical signs were usually asymmetric, and there were consistent and abundant fasciculations predominantly in the perioral muscles. Other features included intention tremor and gynecomastia. The disorder shows X-linked recessive inheritance. Endocrinologic studies suggested an anatomic defect in the hypothalamus leading to androgen deficiency and estrogen excess. \n\nPunnett and Schotland (1979) studied a family with 7 affected males in 4 generations.\n\nPearn and Hudgson (1978) described a spinal muscular atrophy syndrome characterized by adolescent onset, gross hypertrophy of the calves, and a slowly progressive clinical course. They proposed X-linked inheritance for the family of 1 of their patients who had an affected brother and 2 affected maternal uncles. In a study of 100 patients with SMA, Bouwsma and Van Wijngaarden (1980) found 23 cases with hypertrophied calves, elevated serum creatine kinase and onset between 1 and 20 years of age. All were male and many were brothers. \n\nHarding et al. (1982) reported 10 men with SBMA from 8 families. Proximal limb muscle weakness developed in the third to fifth decades of life, often preceded by muscle cramps on exertion and tremor of the hands. Weakness and fasciculation of the facial muscles and tongue were also prominent. All had gynecomastia and some were infertile. Plasma creatine kinase levels were increased and muscle biopsies showed neurogenic atrophy with secondary myopathic changes. \n\nIn 4 Italian males in 3 sibships related as first cousins and by history in their maternal grandfather, Guidetti et al. (1986) described an X-linked adult-onset neurogenic muscular atrophy, mainly proximal, with late distal and bulbar involvement. All patients had essential tremor, gynecomastia, and impotence, although all affected males had children. One patient had hyperlipidemia. \n\nHausmanowa-Petrusewicz et al. (1983) studied 8 of 12 male patients with X-linked spinal muscular atrophy. Six had had gynecomastia. First muscle symptoms began between 21 and 44 years of age, at which time the patients also noted disturbances in their sexual function. Some were reported to have sterility. Biopsy showed pronounced involutional changes in Leydig cells, and plasma testosterone level was decreased. Muscle involvement was most marked proximally in the limbs. Fasciculations in the muscles of the trunk and limbs and fibrillation and atrophy of the tongue were noted. Bulbar muscle involvement was less striking than in reports by others. \n\nWarner et al. (1990) reported 4 affected brothers and an affected maternal uncle. In addition to typical neurologic features including early muscle cramps, visible fasciculation and weakness of oropharyngeal and limb muscles, dysarthria, and areflexia, the patients showed facial asymmetry, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and infertility. All 5 affected males had hypobetalipoproteinemia. Warner et al. (1990) pointed to other reported cases of lipid abnormalities, but concluded that the relationship to the neurologic disorder was unclear. They stated that Fischbeck had informed them in 1989 of linkage between the disorder in this family (Fischbeck et al., 1986) and markers on Xq13.21. \n\nAmato et al. (1993) reported 17 SBMA patients from 7 families. One was a 71-year-old man. Weakness in all patients was usually slowly progressive, but they described 1 exception: a man who rapidly progressed from being a healthy firefighter to wheelchair-dependency in less than 1.5 years. Four carrier females had no clinical features of the disorder. \n\nDoyu et al. (1993) reported a case of extraordinarily late onset of this disorder in an 84-year-old Japanese man, with no family history of any related disease, who noted mild difficulty in climbing stairs when he was in his mid-seventies. At the age of 83, painful muscle cramps in the calves and difficulty in walking were more apparent, although he could ride a bicycle and work in the field. At age 84, he showed diffuse muscular weakness and striking amyotrophy in the 4 limbs as well as in the truncal and facial muscles. The tongue was mildly atrophic, but there was no dysphagia. Fasciculation was striking in his face, tongue, neck, anterior chest, and arm and leg muscles, and was enhanced by mild voluntary contractions. There was no gynecomastia. The number of tandem CAG repeats in the first exon of the AR gene was 40, which was the shortest in the authors' series of patients with SBMA; 45 of their cases showed a range from 40 to 55, and the normal range was 17 to 24. No statement was made about children of the patient. This is likely one of the oldest and most mildly affected patients reported. \n\nIn studies of 34 patients with Kennedy disease, Sperfeld et al. (2002) found that onset was in adolescence, which is earlier than previously thought. Most frequently, early symptoms were gynecomastia, muscle pain, and premature muscle exhaustion. Weakness was not a typical initial symptom and was frequently found in distal limbs if present early. They found a correlation between the number of CAG repeats and the age at onset of weakness, but not to the age at onset of Kennedy disease. \n\nEchaniz-Laguna et al. (2005) reported an Italian family in which 7 boys had early-onset, rapidly progressive SBMA. Molecular analysis detected expanded CAG repeats ranging from 50 to 54, in the intermediate range. The mean age at onset was 13 years (range 8 to 15) of proximal upper and lower limb atrophy and weakness, which was associated with postural upper limb tremor in 4 patients. All patients developed fasciculations and dysarthria in their teens, and 3 patients had loss of independent ambulation in their mid-twenties. All the boys had prepubertal gynecomastia before age 8, without being overweight. EMG tests in 4 patients showed widespread denervation in all four limbs and bulbar muscles. Echaniz-Laguna et al. (2005) noted that 3 patients had been diagnosed with nonspecific limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in childhood. ",
				"Diagnosis": "Georgiou et al. (2001) developed a single-cell PCR assay for the AR gene and described the application of this assay for preimplantation genetic diagnosis in a couple at risk, where the female partner was a carrier of 47 repeats. Diagnosis was based on the detection of both normal and expanded alleles. Allele dropout of the expanded allele was observed. Neither expansions nor contractions were observed in the blastomeres biopsied from 11 embryos. Two embryos were unaffected, 8 were female carriers, and 1 was an affected male embryo. \n",
				"Cytogenetics": "",
				"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations": "La Spada et al. (1991) observed a correlation between CAG length and disease severity. In an analysis of 26 Japanese SBMA patients from 21 families, Doyu et al. (1992) found the same results: the greater the number of CAG repeats, the lower the age of onset of limb muscular weakness and the higher the age-adjusted disability score. La Spada et al. (1992) concluded that although there was a correlation between disease severity and CAG repeat length, other factors seemed to contribute to the phenotypic variability. They found that expanded (CAG)n alleles underwent alteration in length when transmitted from parent to offspring. Of 45 meioses examined, 12 (27%) demonstrated a change in CAG repeat number. Both expansions and contractions were observed, although their magnitude was small. There was a greater rate of instability in male meiosis than in female meiosis. \n\nThe findings of Amato et al. (1993) in 17 patients from 7 families appeared to be at variance with the findings of others: no large expansion of the mutation was observed in transmission through 3 generations of 1 family, and phenotypic expression, although variable between and within families, was not related to the size of the mutation. The authors stated that anticipation had not clearly been observed in Kennedy disease. "

				"Description": "Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive, progressive neurodegenerative disorder which, in the classic infantile form, is usually fatal by age 2 or 3 years.",
				"History": "Fernandes Filho and Shapiro (2004) reviewed the early history of Tay-Sachs disease.",
				"Clinical Features": "Classic Tay-Sachs disease is characterized by the onset in infancy of developmental retardation, followed by paralysis, dementia and blindness, with death in the second or third year of life. A gray-white area around the retinal fovea centralis, due to lipid-laden ganglion cells, leaving a central 'cherry-red' spot is a typical funduscopic finding. Pathologic verification is provided by the finding of the typically ballooned neurons in the central nervous system. An early and persistent extension response to sound ('startle reaction') is useful for recognizing the disorder.\n\nKolodny (1972), who studied the proband described by Okada et al. (1971), stated that visual function was retained and optic atrophy was not present at age 20 months. At death at 32 months, microscopic findings in the central nervous system were similar to those in Tay-Sachs disease. The patients showed normal results in tests that usually demonstrate the Tay-Sachs heterozygote. \n\nSuzuki et al. (1970) and O'Brien (1972) reported non-Jewish patients with the Tay-Sachs variant of juvenile-onset GM2-gangliosidosis. Onset occurred with ataxia between ages 2 and 6 years. Thereafter deterioration to decerebrate rigidity took place. Blindness occurred late in the course in only some patients, unlike the situation in classic Tay-Sachs disease in which blindness is an invariable and early development. Death occurred between ages 5 and 15 years. The defect is a partial deficiency of hexosaminidase A. \n\nRapin et al. (1976) described a brother and 2 sisters of Ashkenazi extraction who had slowly progressive deterioration of gait and posture beginning in early childhood, muscle atrophy beginning distally, pes cavus, foot drop, spasticity, mild ataxia of limbs and trunk, dystonia, and dysarthria. Intelligence was little affected, vision and optic fundi were normal, and no seizures had occurred. One sister died at age 16 following a drug reaction. Autopsy showed diffuse neuronal storage with zebra bodies and increased GM2-ganglioside. Hexosaminidase A was decreased in the serum and leukocytes of the 2 living patients, and in their parents was in the range of carriers of Tay-Sachs disease. The 2 living sibs were 31 and 34 years old at the time of the report. This may be an allelic variety of Tay-Sachs disease. Kaback et al. (1978) described a similar but possibly distinct case. The son of an Ashkenazi couple was entirely normal until age 16 when slight leg muscle cramps began. Hex-A deficiency was found in a screening program at age 20. Both parents and a sister were heterozygotes. Heterokaryon complementation showed the development of Hex-A when the proband's cells were fused with Sandhoff cells, but showed no complementation with Tay-Sachs cells. Between ages 20 and 22, the patient showed dramatically progressive proximal muscle wasting, weakness, fasciculations, EMG abnormality, and elevated CPK. Ophthalmologic, audiologic and intellectual function remained normal. Muscle biopsy suggested anterior horn disease. Rectal ganglion cells showed ballooning and onion-skin cytoplasmic bodies. \n\nWillner et al. (1981) reported 9 patients from 4 unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish families with a variant form of Hex-A deficiency masquerading as atypical Friedreich ataxia. They proposed that the affected individuals may be genetic compounds for the Tay-Sachs allele and another distinctive allele. \n\nJohnson et al. (1982) observed a 24-year-old Ashkenazi man with a 9-year history of progressive leg weakness and fasciculations. Other data were consistent with anterior horn cell disease. Hex-A was markedly decreased in the patient and partially decreased in both parents and a brother. A paternal relative had classic Tay-Sachs disease. The clinical picture, which suggested the Kugelberg-Welander phenotype, may have resulted, according to the suggestion of the authors, from a genetic compound state of the classic allele and a mild allele. \n\nGriffin (1984) had a 31-year-old patient with hexosaminidase deficiency and marked cerebellar atrophy, dementia, and denervation motor neuron disease. Both parents showed a partial deficiency. In 3 patients in 2 unrelated families, Mitsumoto et al. (1985) described adult variants of hexosaminidase A deficiency. A 30-year-old non-Jewish proband in the first family had juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis beginning at age 16 years and evolving to mild dementia, ataxia, and axonal (neuronal) motor-sensory peripheral neuropathy. A supposedly healthy brother, aged 32, had difficulty with memory in college but had obtained 2 degrees in 8 years and worked in an electronics company. He was dismissed from his job for poor memory and comprehension. He showed mild spasticity and ataxia but no evidence of motor neuron disease. In the second family, a 36-year-old man with Ashkenazi mother and Syrian Sephardic father had 'pure' spinal muscular atrophy; he had lifelong physical limitation with inability to run or throw a ball as a child. All 3 had marked cerebellar atrophy. Against artificial substrates, Hex-A activity was in the range of Tay-Sachs disease homozygotes but was higher when GM2 substrates were used. Hex-A activity in the parents was in the heterozygous range. \n\nIn a 34-year-old English Canadian man described by Parnes et al. (1985), the clinical picture was that of juvenile-onset spinal muscular atrophy. Atypical features were prominent muscle cramps, postural and action tremor, recurrent psychosis, incoordination, corticospinal and corticobulbar involvement, and dysarthria. With the report of a 24-year-old, non-Jewish man with dystonia, dementia, amyotrophy, choreoathetosis, and ataxia, Oates et al. (1986) emphasized that presumably allelic forms of Hex-A deficiency can take unusual clinical forms. \n\nIn Israel, Navon et al. (1986) identified 18 Hex-A-deficient adults by the end of 1985. All were Ashkenazi. The clinical picture varied between and within families and included spinocerebellar, various motor neuron, and cerebellar syndromes. The possibility exists that many of the affected persons are compound heterozygotes of the TSD allele with another rare allele. The relatively high frequency of the atypical adult disorder(s) in Ashkenazim is the result of the high frequency of the TSD allele to create genetic compounds. \n\nGrebner et al. (1986) studied 3 clinically normal persons, aged 6 to 30 years, with absent serum Hex-A activity against artificial substrates and concluded that they were probably genetic compounds of the usual Tay-Sachs allele and a different mutant allele that in combination with it gave the abnormal phenotype. Karni et al. (1988) described a 39-year-old Israeli woman with proximal lower limb weakness and fasciculations as the only manifestations of Hex-A deficiency. \n\nBayleran et al. (1987) characterized the defective enzyme in 2 patients with Tay-Sachs disease and a high residual Hex-A activity. Clinical presentation was identical to that found among Ashkenazi patients. Both patients appeared to be heterozygous for the B1 phenotype, having virtually no capacity for hydrolysis of the sulfated HEXA substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate (4MUGS). \n\nBarnes et al. (1991) described a 42-year-old man of non-Jewish ancestry who in his 20s and 30s had the onset of slowly progressive gait disturbance, generalized weakness, dysarthria, clumsiness and tremor of his hands, and involuntary jerks. Two previously unreported features were clinically evident sensory neuropathy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. ",
				"Diagnosis": "Balint et al. (1967) found that both homozygotes and heterozygotes show reduced sphingomyelin in red blood cells and suggested that this reduction is useful in carrier identification.\n\nTriggs-Raine et al. (1990) compared DNA-based and enzyme-based screening tests for carriers of TSD among Ashkenazim. Among 62 Ashkenazi obligate carriers, 3 specific mutations, indicated as 606869.0001, 606869.0002, and 606869.0008 among the allelic variants, accounted for all but one of the mutant alleles (98%). In 216 Ashkenazi carriers identified by the enzyme tests, DNA analysis showed that 177 (82%) had 1 of the identified mutations. Of the 177, 79% had the exon 11 insertion mutation (606869.0001), 18% had the intron 12 splice junction mutation (606869.0002), and 3% had the less severe exon 7 mutation associated with adult-onset disease (606869.0008). The results of the enzyme tests in 39 subjects (18%) who were defined as carriers but in whom DNA analysis did not identify a mutant allele were probably false positive (although there remained some possibility of unidentified mutations). Of 152 persons defined as noncarriers by the enzyme-based test, 1 was identified as a carrier by DNA analysis (i.e., a false-negative enzyme-test result). \n\nTay-Sachs disease was one of the disorders used as a trial for preamplification DNA diagnosis of multiple disorders by Snabes et al. (1994). They applied single-cell whole-genome preamplification to PCR-based analysis of multiple disease loci from the same diploid cell. The method they described allowed diagnosis of multiple disease genes, analysis of multiple exons/introns within a gene, or corroborative embryo-sex assignment and specific mutation detection at sex-linked loci. \n\nAlthough Tay-Sachs mutations are rare in the general population, non-Jewish individuals may be screened as spouses of Jewish carriers or as relatives of probands. To define a panel of alleles that might account for most mutations in non-Jewish carriers, Akerman et al. (1997) investigated 26 independent alleles from 20 obligate carriers and 3 affected individuals. Eighteen alleles were represented by 12 previously identified mutations, 7 that were newly identified and 1 that remained unidentified. They then investigated 46 enzyme-defined carrier alleles: 19 were pseudodeficiency alleles and 5 mutations accounted for 15 other alleles. An eighth new mutation was detected among enzyme-defined carriers. Eleven alleles remained unidentified, despite the testing for 23 alleles. Some may represent false positives for the enzyme test. The results indicated that predominant mutations, other than the 2 pseudodeficiency alleles (739C-T, 606869.0035 and 745C-T) and 1 disease allele (IVS9+1G-A; 606869.0033) do not occur in the general population. Thus, Akerman et al. (1997) concluded that determination of carrier status by DNA analysis alone is inefficient because of the large proportion of rare alleles. Notwithstanding the possibility of false positives inherent to enzyme screening, this method remains an essential component of carrier screening in non-Jews. DNA screening can be best used as an adjunct to enzyme testing to exclude known HEXA pseudodeficiency alleles, the IVS9+1G-A disease allele, and other mutations relevant to the subject's genetic heritage. \n\nBach et al. (2001) presented results strongly supporting the use of DNA testing alone as the most cost-effective and efficient approach to carrier screening for TSD in individuals of confirmed Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. \n\nChamoles et al. (2002) described methods for the assay of hexosaminidase A activity in dried blood spots on filter paper for the screening of newborns. \n\nVallance et al. (2006) reported 2 clinically unaffected Ashkenazi Jewish brothers who had discrepant results on diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease carrier status. Both had low-normal serum percent HexA enzyme activity above the cut-off for carrier detection, but leukocyte HexA activity was in the carrier range. DNA analysis showed that both brothers carried the common 4-bp insertion in the HEXA gene (1277_1278insTATC; 606869.0001) gene. Both also had 2 common polymorphisms in the HEXB gene: 619A-G (I207V) and a 2-bp deletion (delTG) in the 3-prime untranslated region. Genotyping of a larger sample of 72 Jewish and 104 non-Jewish alleles samples found that the HEXB variants were in strong linkage disequilibrium with haplotype frequencies of 9.7% and 7.7%, respectively. Three additional TSD carriers with the unusual biochemical phenotype (normal serum HexA activity and decreased leukocyte HexA activity) all carried the same HEXB I207V/delTG haplotype. Finally, analysis of a larger sample of 69 alleles found that the frequency of this HexB haplotype was significantly associated with low serum HexB activity. These findings indicated that this haplotype lowers HexB activity in serum, which has the effect of raising the percent of HexA activity as determined by heat inactivation methods of total Hex activity. This can result in masking of carrier status in carriers of TSD alleles that are measured solely by serum percentage of HexA activity. Vallance et al. (2006) noted that the high prevalence of this HexB haplotype may become clinically relevant in diagnosis of TSD carrier status, and that additional diagnostic methods should be used. \n\nPrenatal Diagnosis\n\nConzelmann et al. (1985) performed prenatal diagnosis in a family with the pseudo-AB variant (B1 variant) of GM2-gangliosidosis. These patients have a late infantile form with nearly normal beta-hexosaminidase A levels when assayed with the usual synthetic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide. Since the enzyme is also inactive against another substrate that is thought to be hydrolyzed predominantly by Hex-A, the mutation is in the alpha subunit. ",
